In rough order of priority
==========================

Replace Digest::SHA1 with Digest::SHA

Make tests using the database skip_all if it can't connect to the test db

Make tests using the database setup the basic shema automatically 


--- old stuff below ---

Sort out where mime.types is being found.  Is what it says in the
sample configuration right?  What is apache_config used for anyway?

Make sure If-Modified-Since requests are working

None of the internal methods should require $r to be passed

Make the cookie validation code not be hardcoded in Combust::Cookie
(!) (maybe make a Combust::Ticket type thing?)

Make an API to access the notes...

Make Combust::Control::Basic only do the transhandler rather than
serving the file too if it's not going to be processed by template
toolkit.

Read the subversion revision or some "combust-release" file at startup time

/combust-status

think of a way to allow non-text/html content types

Add the include_root and combust revision to the Etag.  If it wasn't
so expensive we could add docs revision as well.  Hmn.  Maybe not useful. 

Make the controller set the INCLUDE_PATH depending on the vhost (or document root?)
  - maybe use a separate configuration file so it's easy to specify
    pulling from svn or from a directory
    - possibly configured per branch?


Cache full html outputs?  Use master svn revision in the cache key. Or
maybe use svn revision for perl.org/backend/ combined with svn
revision for perl.org/docs/[site]/.  (are we providing enough options
for this now?)

Set Last-Updated properly.  (did we do this?)

Handle If-Modified-Since requests.

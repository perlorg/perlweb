<h2>
Quick Summary</h2>
Source enters the parser. The parser emits a syntax tree.
<p>The syntax tree enters the compiler. The compiler spits out bytecode.
<p>The bytecode enters the optimizer. The optimizer spits out more bytecode.
<br>(But better!)
<p>The bytecode enters the runtime, which then Does Something with the
<br>bytecode. (Presumably run it, but possibly turn it to Java bytecode,
or
<br>.NET bytecode, or an Alpha executable, or an encoded DNA sequence for
<br>fruitflies or something)
<p>Or, in glorious ASCII art form (data flows from top to bottom):

<h2>
The Plans</h2>
The parser will permit you to change its rules.&nbsp; Rule sets define
major languages (Perl, C, Python, Java, etc.) and you can write new rules
to define minor languages (Perl without $ @ % sigils, Python with curly
braces, etc.).
<p>The runtime engine (which Dan has codenamed "<a href="http://www.perl.com/pub/2001/04/01/parrot.htm">Parrot</a>")
is a register-based virtual machine (compare to
the perl5 virtual machine, which is stack-based).&nbsp; Combined with this
and work on vtables (values have tables of operations attached to them),
we hope the virtual machine will be faster and more powerful than that
of perl5.
<p>One of the major reasons to revisit Perl was to fix the mess that is
XS (the way you extend Perl with C or C++ subroutines).&nbsp; Perl5 has
no API for extension, separate from the functions used to implement Perl,
and extending Perl requires hideous amounts of work.&nbsp; Dan and Larry
are aiming to make C extensions as easy as they possibly can be (Brian
Ingerson's excellent perl5 <a href="http://www.perl.com/pub/2001/02/inline.html">Inline</a>
modules give some directions for this).&nbsp; Anyone who has used XS looks
forward to its demise.
<p>Perl5 was designed in such a way that it would run wherever there was
C.&nbsp; These days, though, it's becoming more and more common to not
have C but instead to have some kind of virtual machine (JVM, .NET, etc.).&nbsp;
So we'd like to have our own virtual machine that will run wherever there's
C, but also to make it easy to port the bytecode to another virtual machine
for places without C.

<h4>
    What's Parrot
</h4>
<p>
    Parrot is a virtual machine used to efficiently execute bytecode for interpreted languages - specifically, Perl 6, although we would like to keep the door open for other languages in the future. As such, Parrot will be the core of the Perl interpreter; it will be the target platform to which Perl 6 code is compiled.
</p>
<h4>
    Where are we
</h4>
<p>
    Parrot source code was released to the world on Monday 10th of September 2001; since then, an army of developers have furiously been hacking away on it. Currently, we have a virtual machine to execute bytecode, an intermediate and an assembly language, a definition for abstract syntax trees, and compilers that translate these three representations to byte code.
</p>
<p>
    A just-in-time compiler and a garbage collector are implemented.
</p>
<p>
    There's a Perl 6 compiler being worked on, <a
    href="http://rakudo.org/">rakudo</a>, which implements variables, control
    flow statements, operators, classes, roles, objects, multi method
    dispatch, regexes, grammars, meta operators and junctions. See the <a
    href="http://rakudo.org/status">status page</a> for a regularly updated
    list of implemented features.

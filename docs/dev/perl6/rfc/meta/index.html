<H1>About Perl6 RFCs</H1>

The initial design phase of perl6 is where we produce suggestions
for Larry to evaluate.  We're brainstorming, but want to structure
the output of the brainstorming so that it's useful for Larry.
That's what RFCs are: every idea that someone wants in Perl should
have an RFC produced for it.<P>

Larry has commented on the scope and nature of the changes expected in
version 6 of Perl.  Some messages are <A HREF="larry-1.txt">here</A>,
<A HREF="larry-2.txt">here</A>, and <A HREF="larry-3.txt">here</A>.<P>

The RFC format is <A HREF="rfc-format.html">here</A> (last changed
July 31, 2000).  A sample
(fictitious) RFC is <A HREF="rfc-sample.pod">here in POD format</A>,
and <A HREF="rfc-sample.html">here formatted as HTML</A>.<P>

Here's the process for submitting an RFC:

<OL>
<LI>Mail it to <I>perl6-rfc@perl.org</I>
</OL>

The librarian will:

<OL>
<LI>Assign it a number if it doesn't already have one.
<LI>Put it on the web site.
<LI>Mail it to the perl6-announce mailing list, with Reply-To set
to the discussion list named in the RFC.
</OL>

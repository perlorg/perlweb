        Strawberry Perl is a distribution of the Perl programming language for the Microsoft Windows platform. While most other distributions rely on the user having software development tools already set up to install certain Perl components, Strawberry Perl ships with the most commonly used tools pre-configured and packaged.

        The <a href="http://www.raku.org/">Raku</a> project (formerly known as Perl 6) is a new language. Perl and Raku are two languages in the Perl family, but of different lineages. Raku is not intended as a replacement for Perl, but as its own thing - and libraries exist to allow you to call Perl code from Raku programs and vice versa.

[% page.title = "Getting and Working With the Perl Source" %]

<p>
The Perl source code is currently kept in a <a href="https://git-scm.com/">Git</a>
repository, which is browseable through a web interface at <a
href="https://github.com/Perl/perl5">https://github.com/Perl/perl5</a>.
</p>

<p>The easiest way to copy the Perl repository is to use git:</p>
<pre>
  git clone https://github.com/Perl/perl5.git perl
</pre>
<p>The master branch, where the development takes places, is named
<i>blead</i>. The maintenance branches are named <i>maint-5.XXX</i>
depending on the maintenance version.
</p>

<p>
For more details on working with the Perl source code, please see the
<a href="http://perldoc.perl.org/perlhack.html#GETTING-THE-PERL-SOURCE"
   >perlhack</a> documentation.
</p>

<p>If you are interested in released versions of perl, you can
download them from the
CPAN <a href="http://www.cpan.org/src/README.html">Perl Source
    Code</a> page.

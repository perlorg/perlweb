Perl 5.18.4 represents approximately 9 months of development since Perl 5.18.2
and contains approximately 2,000 lines of changes across 53 files from 13
authors.

Perl continues to flourish into its third decade thanks to a vibrant community
of users and developers. The following people are known to have contributed the
improvements that became Perl 5.18.4:

Daniel Dragan, David Mitchell, Doug Bell, Father Chrysostomos, Hiroo Hayashi,
James E Keenan, Karl Williamson, Mark Shelor, Ricardo Signes, Shlomi Fish,
Smylers, Steve Hay, Tony Cook.

The list above is almost certainly incomplete as it is automatically generated
from version control history. In particular, it does not include the names of
the (very much appreciated) contributors who reported issues to the Perl bug
tracker.

Many of the changes included in this version originated in the CPAN modules
included in Perl's core. We're grateful to the entire CPAN community for
helping Perl to flourish.

For a more complete list of all of Perl's historical contributors, please see
the AUTHORS file in the Perl source distribution.

The next major stable release of Perl 5, version 22.0, should appear in May
2015.

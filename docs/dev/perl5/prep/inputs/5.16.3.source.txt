Perl 5.16.3 represents approximately 4 months of development since Perl 5.16.2
and contains approximately 870 lines of changes across 39 files from 7 authors.

Perl continues to flourish into its third decade thanks to a vibrant community
of users and developers. The following people are known to have contributed the
improvements that became Perl 5.16.3:

Andy Dougherty, Chris 'BinGOs' Williams, Dave Rolsky, David Mitchell, Michael
Schroeder, Ricardo Signes, Yves Orton.

The list above is almost certainly incomplete as it is automatically generated
from version control history. In particular, it does not include the names of
the (very much appreciated) contributors who reported issues to the Perl bug
tracker.

For a more complete list of all of Perl's historical contributors, please see
the AUTHORS file in the Perl source distribution.

The next major stable release of Perl 5, version 18.0, should appear in May
2013.

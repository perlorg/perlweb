    The list above is almost certainly incomplete as it is automatically
    generated from version control history.  In particular, it does not
    include the names of the (very much appreciated) contributors who
    reported issues to the Perl bug tracker.
</p>
<p>
    Many of the changes included in this version originated in the CPAN
    modules included in Perl's core.  We're grateful to the entire CPAN
    community for helping Perl to flourish.
</p>
<p>
    For a more complete list of all of Perl's historical contributors,
    please see the AUTHORS file in the Perl source distribution.
</p>
<p>
    We expect to release Perl 5.16.1 on or around June 20, 2012, addressing
    significant bugs found after this release.  The 5.17 development branch
    will open shortly, and a 5.17.0 release will follow within the month,
    with regular monthly releases following on the 20th of each month.  The
    next major stable release of Perl 5, version 5.18.0, should appear in
    May 2013.

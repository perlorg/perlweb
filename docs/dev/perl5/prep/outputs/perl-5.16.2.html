Perl continues to flourish into its third decade thanks to a vibrant
community of users and developers.  The following people are known to have
contributed the improvements that became Perl 5.16.2:
</p>

<p>
Andy Dougherty, Craig A. Berry, Darin McBride, Dominic Hargreaves, Karen
Etheridge, Karl Williamson, Peter Martini, Ricardo Signes, Tony Cook.
</p>

<p>
The list above is almost certainly incomplete as it is automatically
generated from version control history.  In particular, it does not include
the names of the (very much appreciated) contributors who reported issues
to the Perl bug tracker.
</p>

<p>
Many of the changes included in this version originated in the CPAN modules
included in Perl's core.  We're grateful to the entire CPAN community for
helping Perl to flourish.

stable release of Perl 5, version 5.18.0, should appear in May 2013.

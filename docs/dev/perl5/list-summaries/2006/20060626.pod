=head1 This Week on perl5-porters - 26 June-2 July 2006

I<"But having it match what perl6 will do is even more important
than having it make perfect sense, IMO.">, Yitzchak Scott-Thoennes,
thinking about forwards compatibility.

=head1 Topics of Interest

=head2 C<exit> and C<die> in threads

Following on from the threads 1.33 conversation last week that was
given short shrift in last week's summary (sorry Jerry), Jerry D.
Hedden put forward a proposal to nail down the semantics of what
happens when a thread calls C<exit> (and more to the point, what
to do about everything that might want to clean up after itself).
Throw in a C<__WARN__> and/or C<__DIE__> handler or two, and you're
starting to talk about some serious fun.

Jan Dubois and Rafael Garcia-Suarez commented on a number of points
that Jerry raised, and while Rafael didn't agree with a few things,
he was quick to point out that he didn't have any definite opinions
one way or another, only that he wanted the best possible solution
to come out the discussion.

Dave Mitchell wondered whether it wouldn't be possible to add an
C<exit> method to the threads class, which would apply only to the
thread, leaving the core C<exit> to behave as usual.

  In through the out door
  http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/perl5-porters/2006-06/msg00996.html

Jerry the checked with the porters to see whether everyone agreed
to what he thought threads should do. Jan and Liz Mattijsen gave
their assent.

  http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/perl5-porters/2006-06/msg01046.html

Just to be really certain, Jerry then posted a consensuality
matrix, to get people who had made suggestions to sign off, or
explain what they disagreed about. The moral of the story is
that calling C<exit()> as a thread method ends the thread, but
calling C<exit()> ends everything, modulo some differences in
opinion over how much to warn about and when.

  fluid neon origami trick
  http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/perl5-porters/2006-06/msg01049.html

Jerry went about modifying the threads module to do all this and
ran into problems with too many C<ENTER>s and not enough C<LEAVE>s
and the like. Jan said that he had no time to look closely, but
eyeballed Jerry's code, sketched out a brief idea of what needed
to be done. Jerry picked it up and ran with it, and straightened
out all the problems.

  Balancing act
  http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/perl5-porters/2006-06/msg01087.html

By the end of the week, Jerry had the new implementation up and
running to his satisfaction, except for a nagging problem of
C<die> messages not being captured by the test harness, thus
polluting the output.

  Weaving in and out
  http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/perl5-porters/2006-06/msg01134.html

Dave Mitchell listed the available possibilities:

=head2 The last remaining eval leaks

After having looked over the stellar achievements of Dave Mitchell
in removing C<eval> leaks (caused when the C<eval>'ed code fails),
Nicholas Clark listed the remaining known leaks and asked for help
in trying to identify the code paths taken (which would help in
figuring out how to plug them).

Dr. Ruud suggested taking a look at a tool called C<MemProf>.
Dominic Dunlop answered the question with a question, and offered
another leak to add to the list.

  Lost property
  http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/perl5-porters/2006-06/msg01001.html

=head2 Did You Know This Worked?

chromatic posted a short, sharp snippet of C, showing how easy it
is to insert your own XS code into an existing op code, which opens
up all sorts of interesting possibilities.

  http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/perl5-porters/2006-06/msg01007.html

=head2 Is C<$A::::B::C> a bug or feature?

Continuing in the I-didn't-know-Perl-could-do-that vein, Chip Salzenberg
discovered that this meant that C<C> is inside package C<::B::> which
in turn is inside C<A>, and thought it was all rather evil.

Sadahiro Tomoyuki traced the change down to somewhere between 5.004_04
and 5.004_05, when C<scan_words> in F<toke.c> was modified to permit
this, some time back in 2003. No-one appeared to remember the reason.

  http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/perl5-porters/2006-07/msg00001.html

=head2 Questions regarding smart match and scalar upgrades in Perl 5

Steve Peters was going over the new smart match (C<~~>) operator
from Perl 6, that Robin Houston added to C<blead> last year, and
making sure it was well tested. He wrote a couple of tests, was
puzzled by the results, and wondered whether the problem lay with
the implementation, or with the documentation.

Yitzchak Scott-Thoennes analysed Steve's reasoning, but no firm
conclusions were made.

  http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/perl5-porters/2006-06/msg01120.html

=head2 C<Win32API::File> now in core

Steve Hay announced that he had set things up to make C<Win32API::File>
a first-class dual-lifed module, in C<blead> and on CPAN. He called on
Jan Dubois to see whether Jan needed or wanted to do anything about
C<libwin32>. There was discussion of moving files from C<win32/ext/Win32>
to C<ext/Win32>, which would ease the building of perl on Cygwin.

  It just got bigger
  http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/perl5-porters/2006-06/msg01129.html

Some discussion followed as to whether or not it would make it in time
for 5.8.9.

=head1 Patches of Interest

=head2 F<vms.c> - null termination of string missing.

John E. Malmberg offered a short patch to correct a function that failed
to append a null character to strings, which gave the underlying C library
indigestion since it was expecting one. Rafael applied.

  Overshooting yourself in the foot
  http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/perl5-porters/2006-06/msg00974.html

Similarly, Jarkko Hietaniemi taught C<cflags.SH> to scan the gcc
warning flags only once:

  http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/perl5-porters/2006-06/msg01015.html

=head2 Adding C<splint> support

Andy Lester set about adding C<splint> (a C<lint>-like tool) support
for the porters. First off he created some F<embed.pl> enhancements:

  http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/perl5-porters/2006-07/msg00022.html

And then followed with some F<Makefile> C<splint> support. It doesn't
quite do everything that it should, and Andy called upon other people
(hi Jarkko!) for help.

  http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/perl5-porters/2006-07/msg00024.html

=head2 Dispatches from the C<const>ing front

Elsewhere in the code base, Andy tweaked F<DProf.xs> to only compile
a small static function if in fact it was actually required in the
current configuration.

  http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/perl5-porters/2006-07/msg00023.html

He then turned his attention to ye cruftey olde F<mathoms.c>. Just
because they're obsolete doesn't mean they can't be squeaky clean.

  http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/perl5-porters/2006-07/msg00026.html

And for dessert, Andy tidied up F<mg.c>, by localising a variable
here and there, and encapsulating C<Perl_*> calls in macros.

  http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/perl5-porters/2006-07/msg00028.html

=head2 Removing an inconsistent C<close $fh>

Vadim Konovalov wanted to clean up F<win32/buildext.pl> by removing an
explicit C<close>, since just nearby is a similar C<open> that also omits
the C<close>.

Yves Orton that a better idea was to rewrite the code, because it's a
complete mess. (Amd it isn't particularly big, either).

=head1 Watching the smoke signals

=head2 Smoke [5.9.4] 28420 FAIL(FMm) OSF1 V5.1 (EV6/4 cpu)]

Jarkko noted some failures had been cropping up in recent smokes, but
didn't feel they were specific to the platform (Tru64) he was running.

Nicholas Clark explained what the issues were. One was a simple test
design issue that anybody with a reasonable grasp of designing tests
should be able to figure out. Alas, no-one had volunteered to have a
look. Jarkko asked for more background.

  Background check
  http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/perl5-porters/2006-06/msg00090.html

The other issue was one of C<eval> leaks, and Jarkko courageously
deferred to Dave Mitchell as the likely fixer of that.

  Snot funny
  http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/perl5-porters/2006-06/msg01000.html

=head2 Smoke [5.9.4] 28452 FAIL(F) MSWin32 WinXP/.Net SP2 (x86/2 cpu)

Anno Siegel looked at one of Steve Hay's smokes, and wondered how one
was supposed to interpret the results. H. Merijn Brand explained the
general case, and Steve explained what was going wrong in this
particular case.

  Inconsistent test results (between TEST and harness)
  http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/perl5-porters/2006-06/msg01127.html

=head2  Smoke [5.9.4] 28456 FAIL(c) Solaris 2.10 (i386/1 cpu)

H.Merijn looked at one of Abe Timmerman's failing Solaris smokes and
traced it down to a change he'd made to C<Configure> following on
from a suggestion from Andy Dougherty. Andy thanked H.Merijn for the
catch and noted that the entire hack was no longer needed anyway,
since the original problem (one of 64-bit tests) has since been
fixed.

=head1 New and old bugs from RT

=head2 problem on installing DBI module (#39527)

Jan Dubois wrote to say that it is possible to install C<DBD::Oracle>
for ActiveState, at the price of also downloading many megabytes
of Oracle libraries.

  But alas, only for 5.6
  http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/perl5-porters/2006-06/msg01081.html

=head2 Pattern Match fails for specific length string (#39583)

The code was corrected to handle this problem, and Yves folded the
original bug report into the test suite. Yves then went on to
rewrite the regexp display code, since, up until now, control
characters have always been invisible, which makes it much harder
to understand bug reports when control characters are present.

  She's lost control
  http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/perl5-porters/2006-07/msg00012.html

=head2 nl_langinfo ==E<gt> Installation problems (#39625)

Jaymax was having problems upgrading 5.8.2 to 5.8.8. C<miniperl>
was dying with a C<Undefined symbol "nl_langinfo"> error. No
takers as yet.

  http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/perl5-porters/2006-06/msg00963.html

=head2 Using nonsensical key in C<%SIG> should generate a warning (#39630)

Nik thought that he would have saved a lot of time if perl complained
about trying to use keys in C<%SIG> that don't refer to valid signal
handlers. Rafael thought that the problem might be because that the
code in question was not, in fact, running with warnings enabled.

  Ask no questions, tell no lies
  http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/perl5-porters/2006-06/msg00976.html

=head2 C<@ISA> is not mentioned in C<perlvar> (#39633)

Sebastian Schmidt kicked off a long thread about whether or not
C<@ISA> should be referenced in C<perlvar> or not. The main
dissent was due to the fact that C<@ISA> isn't particularly
special as far as perl is concerned, it merely has lots of
cultural conventions associated with it.

Nevertheless, it was agreed that C<perlvar> should in fact list
all extraordinary variables, with C<< LE<lt>E<gt> >> references
to the appropriate pages if a better definition already existed
elsewhere.

  http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/perl5-porters/2006-06/msg01010.html

=head2 gcc 3.3 has problems with C<__attribute__((unused))> (#39634)

John Gardiner Myers was having some trouble compiling C<Encode::Detect>
with the GNU C++ compiler. Andy Dougherty realised that C<blead> had
already solved this problem and proposed a couple of patches to get
things going. John, however, had another patch that he thought was
better. After looking at it, Andy did too. He tidied it up slightly,
and suggested that it was fit for inclusion to both C<blead> and
C<maint>.

  http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/perl5-porters/2006-06/msg01004.html

=head2 Configure (on Solaris 64-bit) fails (#39636)

Marc Esser was having trouble configuring perl on Solaris 10. After a
getting Marc to try a few things, Andy Dougherty believed that he had
isolated the problem in some incorrect hints for Solaris.

  http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/perl5-porters/2006-06/msg01011.html

=head2 filetest problem with C<STDIN>/C<STDOUT> on Windows (#39637)

Paul Marquess reported that he had had some problems with not being
able to apply C<-r> to C<\*STDIN> and get a sensible result back on
Windows.

  Par for the course
  http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/perl5-porters/2006-06/msg01016.html

=head2 C<perldoc -f waitpid> has wrong code example (#39639)

Alexander Gernler mentioned that he thought the snippet explaining
C<waitpid> was wrong, and that it should use a C<do/while> loop and
not a C<do/until> loop. Rafael agreed, and Salvador Fandiño and
Dr. Ruud made a few suggestion about making the snippet truly
cross platform (well, and least Unix and Windows).

=head2 F<XSUB.h> in perl v5.8.8 with gcc 3.4.6 (#39644)

Jon V. had a weird compilation error. Rafael suspected that some
errant header was defining a symbol standing in for a function or something,
as a number.

  http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/perl5-porters/2006-06/msg01061.html

=head2 C<DynaLoader> corrupts C<%ENV> (#39647)

Daniel Pfeiffer as having trouble with a Solaris 2.10 box coming to grief
with environment variables eating all available memory. Rafael had trouble
reproducing it. So did Daniel for that matter. Unfortunately, there's not
much to go on.

  http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/perl5-porters/2006-06/msg01062.html

=head2 C<require> and C<List::MoreUtils> seg fault (#39650)

Darin McBride had some code worked if C<List::MoreUtils>
was C<use>d, but dumped core if it was C<require>d. Rafael saw that the
problem lay in the module building an iterator as a closure to traverse
an array, but couldn't see off-hand why it should fail.

=head2 perl crashes with simple regex (#39652)

Another back-tracking stack-blowing pattern.

=head2 Regex performance with UTF-8 strings (#39654)

Peter J.Holzer discovered that taking a simple byte string and upgrading
it to UTF-8 makes the match go three times slower when the target remains
byte-encoded. Or, to put it another way, if the polarity of the target
and regexp are reversed, performance is awful.

Even Yves admitted to being scared at the amount of effort required to
make the engine do the right thing. It's doable, and he's thought about it
on occasion. Sadahiro Tomoyuki gave Peter a tip that helped in improve the
performance in his particular case.

  Fruit at the top of the tree
  http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/perl5-porters/2006-06/msg01076.html

Yves went onto to explain far more than you ever wanted to know about UTF-8,
and just how much effort it takes to move to the next character in a string.
Juerd suggested a number of optimisations that, if implemented, may improve
performance. Yves went down the list and pointed out that nearly all of
Juerd's ideas I<are> already implemented in the engine in some way or another.

In other sub-thread, Sadahiro caught a naughty macro that lacked
a parenthesised argument, which Rafael fixed in blead.

  It ain't easy

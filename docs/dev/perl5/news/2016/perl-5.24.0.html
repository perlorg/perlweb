<p>
The list above is almost certainly incomplete as it is automatically
generated from version control history. In particular, it does not include
the names of the (very much appreciated) contributors who reported issues
to the Perl bug tracker.
</p>

<p>
Many of the changes included in this version originated in the CPAN modules
included in Perl's core. We're grateful to the entire CPAN community for
helping Perl to flourish.
</p>

<p>
For a more complete list of all of Perl's historical contributors, please
see the AUTHORS file in the Perl source distribution.
</p>

<p>
We expect to release perl v5.25.0 today, followed by perl v5.25.1 on May
20th.  The next major stable release of Perl 5, version 26.0, should appear
in May 2017.
</p>

<p>
It has been my great pleasure to contribute to the development of Perl for
the past five major releases.  This will be my final major release. Thank
you, everyone who has contributed to the project or offered kind words of
support.  They have been appreciated perhaps more than has been adequately
communicated.
</p>

<p>
Beginning with perl v5.25.1, Sawyer X will be the new reigning pumpking.
Please be as kind to him as you have to me!
</p>

<h3>Patches fix sprintf buffer overflow</h3>
<p>
  The Perl community has released a fix to the <tt>sprintf</tt> function
  that was recently discovered to have a buffer overflow in very specific
  cases.  All Perl users should consider updating immediately.
</p>

  Dyad Security recently released
  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060218201441/http://dyadsecurity.com/perl-0002.html">a security advisory</a> 
  (<a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2005-3962">CVE-2005-3962</a> and
  <a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2005-3912">CVE-2005-3912</a>)
  explaining how in certain cases, a carefully crafted format string
  passed to <tt>sprintf</tt> can cause a buffer overflow.  This buffer
  overflow can then be used by an attacker to execute code on the machine.
  This was discovered in the context of a design problem with the Webmin
  administration package that allowed a malicious user to pass unchecked
  data into <tt>sprintf</tt>.  A related fix for Sys::Syslog
  <a href="https://news.perlfoundation.org/post/perl_patches_fix_sprintf_buffe"
  >has already been released</A>.
</p>

<p>
  The Perl 5 Porters team have solved this <tt>sprintf</tt> overflow
  problem, and have released a set of patches, specific to four different
  versions of Perl.
</p>

<ul>
    <li>For Perl 5.8.0<br>
    <a href="ftp://ftp.cpan.org/pub/CPAN/authors/id/N/NW/NWCLARK/sprintf-5.8.0.patch"
        >ftp://ftp.cpan.org/pub/CPAN/authors/id/N/NW/NWCLARK/sprintf-5.8.0.patch</a></li>

    <li>For Perl 5.8.1 and 5.8.2<br>
    <a href="ftp://ftp.cpan.org/pub/CPAN/authors/id/N/NW/NWCLARK/sprintf-5.8.2.patch"
        >ftp://ftp.cpan.org/pub/CPAN/authors/id/N/NW/NWCLARK/sprintf-5.8.2.patch</a></li>

    <li>For Perl 5.8.3<br>
    <a href="ftp://ftp.cpan.org/pub/CPAN/authors/id/N/NW/NWCLARK/sprintf-5.8.3.patch"
        >ftp://ftp.cpan.org/pub/CPAN/authors/id/N/NW/NWCLARK/sprintf-5.8.3.patch</a></li>

    <li>For Perl 5.8.4 through 5.8.7<br>
    <a href="ftp://ftp.cpan.org/pub/CPAN/authors/id/N/NW/NWCLARK/sprintf-5.8.7.patch"
        >ftp://ftp.cpan.org/pub/CPAN/authors/id/N/NW/NWCLARK/sprintf-5.8.7.patch</a></li>
</ul>

<p>
While this specific patch fixes a buffer overflow, and thus prevents
malicious code execution, programmers must still be careful.
Patched or not, <tt>sprintf</tt> can still be used as the basis of a
denial-of-service attack.  It will create huge, memory-eating blocks of
data if passed malicious format strings from an attacker.  It's best if
no unchecked data from outside sources get passed to <tt>sprintf</tt>,
either directly or through a function such as <tt>syslog</tt>.

<p>
The list above is almost certainly incomplete as it is automatically
generated from version control history. In particular, it does not include
the names of the (very much appreciated) contributors who reported issues
to the Perl bug tracker.
</p>

<p>
Many of the changes included in this version originated in the CPAN modules
included in Perl's core. We're grateful to the entire CPAN community for
helping Perl to flourish.
</p>

<p>
For a more complete list of all of Perl's historical contributors, please
see the AUTHORS file in the Perl source distribution.
</p>

<p>
We expect to release perl v5.22.1 in about a month, give or take.  The next
major version of Perl 5, version 24.0, should appear in May 2016.
</p>

<p>
The first release of Perl 5's sister language, Perl 6, is expected around
Christmas 2015.

community of users and developers.  The following people are known to have
contributed the improvements that became Perl 5.24.1:

The list above is almost certainly incomplete as it is automatically
generated from version control history.  In particular, it does not include
the names of the (very much appreciated) contributors who reported issues
to the Perl bug tracker.
</p>

<p>
Many of the changes included in this version originated in the CPAN modules
included in Perl's core.  We're grateful to the entire CPAN community for
helping Perl to flourish.

    Perl continues to flourish into its third decade thanks to a vibrant
    community of users and developers.  The following people are known to
    have contributed the improvements that became Perl 5.16.1:
</p>
<p>
    Chris 'BinGOs' Williams, Craig A. Berry, Father Chrysostomos, Karl Williamson,
    Paul Johnson, Reini Urban, Ricardo Signes, Tony Cook.
</p>
<p>
    The list above is almost certainly incomplete as it is automatically
    generated from version control history.  In particular, it does not
    include the names of the (very much appreciated) contributors who
    reported issues to the Perl bug tracker.
</p>
<p>
    Many of the changes included in this version originated in the CPAN
    modules included in Perl's core.  We're grateful to the entire CPAN
    community for helping Perl to flourish.
</p>
<p>
    For a more complete list of all of Perl's historical contributors,
    please see the AUTHORS file in the Perl source distribution.
</p>
<p>
    We expect to release Perl 5.16.2 around November 1, 2012.

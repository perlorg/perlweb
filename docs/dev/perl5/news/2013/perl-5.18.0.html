The list above is almost certainly incomplete as it is automatically
generated from version control history. In particular, it does not include
the names of the (very much appreciated) contributors who reported issues
to the Perl bug tracker.
</p>

<p>
Many of the changes included in this version originated in the CPAN modules
included in Perl's core. We're grateful to the entire CPAN community for
helping Perl to flourish.
</p>

<p>
For a more complete list of all of Perl's historical contributors, please
see the AUTHORS file in the Perl source distribution.

<p>
We expect to release v5.19.0 on Monday, May 20th, 2013.  The next major
stable release of Perl 5, version 20, should appear in May 2014.

<P>The Release Candidate Three (RC3) for the Perl maintenance release 5.8.1
has been released.</P>
<P>Please test RC3 extensively, even if you had no problems with the RC1
and RC2.  In RC3 we made the new 'randomised hashes' feature to be on
by default, erring on the side of security.  See the appended
perldelta for more details on this.</P>
<P>Several hundreds of bugs have been fixed.  See the appended perldelta
for selected fixes.</P>
<P>Please test RC3 extensively.  If nothing major is found to be broken,
the final 5.8.1 will soon follow.</P>
<P>This is a source code release only: you will need a C/C++ compilation
environment to build it.  If you haven't built Perl before from the
sources, please read the INSTALL file carefully.</P>
<P>Report any problems using the perlbug utility, for example by</P>
<PRE>
    ./perl -Ilib utils/perlbug</PRE>
<P>If the perlbug utility doesn't work, try sending email directly to
<A HREF="mailto:perlbug@perl.org.">perlbug@perl.org.</A>  In either method, please have a clear Subject line
and a clear description of your problem.  In the latter method please
also include your configuration, which you can get for example by</P>
<PRE>
   ./myconfig -V &gt; cf</PRE>
<P>(the perlbug utility includes the configuration automatically)</P>
<P>The Release Candidate Three is available from</P>

<P>It is a GNU zipped tar file which will unpack to a directory called
perl-5.8.1-RC3.</P>

<H1><A NAME="name">NAME</A></H1>
<P>perldelta - what is new for perl v5.8.1</P>
<P>
<HR>
<H1><A NAME="description">DESCRIPTION</A></H1>
<P>This document describes differences between the 5.8.0 release and
the 5.8.1 release.</P>
<P>If you are upgrading from an earlier release like 5.6.1, read first
the <EM>perl58delta</EM>, which describes differences between 5.6.0 and
5.8.0.</P>
<P>
<HR>
<H1><A NAME="incompatible changes">Incompatible Changes</A></H1>
<P>
<h3><A NAME="hash randomisation">Hash Randomisation</A></H2>
<P>Mainly due to security reasons, the ``random ordering'' of hashes
has been made even more random.  Previously while the order of hash
elements from keys(), values(), and <CODE>each()</CODE> was essentially random,
it was still repeatable.  Now, however, the order varies between
different runs of Perl.</P>
<P><STRONG>Perl has never guaranteed any ordering of the hash keys</STRONG>, and the
ordering has already changed several times during the lifetime of
Perl 5.  Also, the ordering of hash keys has always been, and
continues to be, affected by the insertion order.</P>
<P>The added randomness may affect applications.</P>
<P>One possible scenario is when output of an application has included
hash data.  For example, if you have used the Data::Dumper module to
dump data into different files, and then compared the files to see
whether the data has changed, now you will have false positives since
the order in which hashes are dumped will vary.  In general the cure
is to sort the keys (or the values); in particular for Data::Dumper to
use the <CODE>Sortkeys</CODE> option; or if some particular order is really
important, use tied hashes.</P>
<P>More subtle problem is reliance on the order of ``global destruction''.
That is what happens at the end of execution: Perl destroys all data
structures, including user data.  If your destructors (the DESTROY
subroutines) have assumed any particular ordering to the global
destruction, there might be problems ahead.  For example, in a
destructor of one object you cannot assume that objects of any other
class are still available, unless you hold a reference to them.
If the environment variable PERL_DESTRUCT_LEVEL is set to a non-zero
value, or if Perl is exiting a spawned thread, it will also destruct
the ordinary references and the symbol tables that are no longer in use.
You can't call a class method or an ordinary function on a class that
has been collected that way.</P>
<P>The hash randomisation is certain to reveal hidden assumptions about
some particular ordering of hash elements, and outright bugs: it
revealed a few bugs in the Perl core and core modules.</P>
<P>To disable the hash randomisation in runtime, set the environment
variable PERL_HASH_SEED to 0 (zero) before running Perl (for more
information see <EM>perlrun/PERL_HASH_SEED</EM>), or to disable the feature
completely in compile time, compile with <CODE>-DNO_HASH_SEED</CODE> (see <EM>INSTALL</EM>).</P>
<P>See <EM>perlsec/``Algorithmic Complexity Attacks''</EM> for the original
rationale behind this change.</P>
<P>
<h3><A NAME="utf8 on filehandles no longer activated by locale">UTF-8 On Filehandles No Longer Activated By Locale</A></H2>
<P>In Perl 5.8.0 all filehandles, including the standard filehandles,
were implicitly set to be in Unicode UTF-8 if the locale settings
indicated the use of UTF-8.  This feature caused too many problems,
so the feature was turned off and redesigned: see <A HREF="#core enhancements">Core Enhancements</A>.</P>
<P>
<h3><A NAME="singlenumber vstrings are no longer vstrings before =>">Single-number v-strings are no longer v-strings before ``=&gt;''</A></H2>
<P>The version strings or v-strings (see <EM>perldata/``Version Strings''</EM>)
feature introduced in Perl 5.6.0 has been a source of some confusion--
especially when the user did not want to use it, but Perl thought it
knew better.  Especially troublesome has been the feature that before
a ``=&gt;'' a version string (a ``v'' followed by digits) has been interpreted
as a v-string instead of a string literal.  In other words:</P>
<PRE>
        %h = ( v65 =&gt; 42 );</PRE>
<P>has meant since Perl 5.6.0</P>
<PRE>
        %h = ( 'A' =&gt; 42 );</PRE>
<P>(at least in platforms of ASCII progeny)  Perl 5.8.1 restores the
more natural interpretation</P>
<PRE>
        %h = ( 'v65' =&gt; 42 );</PRE>
<P>The multi-number v-strings like v65.66 and 65.66.67 still continue
to be v-strings.</P>
<P>
<h3><A NAME="(win32) the c switch has been repurposed">(Win32) The -C Switch Has Been Repurposed</A></H2>
<P>The -C switch has changed in an incompatible way.  The old semantics
of this switch only made sense in Win32 and only in the ``use utf8''
universe in 5.6.x releases, and do not make sense for the Unicode
implementation in 5.8.0.  Since this switch could not have been used
by anyone, it has been repurposed.  The behavior that this switch
enabled in 5.6.x releases may be supported in a transparent,
data-dependent fashion in a future release.</P>
<P>For the new life of this switch, see <A HREF="#utf8 no longer default under utf8 locales">UTF-8 no longer default under UTF-8 locales</A>, and <EM>perlrun/-C</EM>.</P>
<P>
<h3><A NAME="(win32) the /d switch of cmd.exe">(Win32) The /d Switch Of cmd.exe</A></H2>
<P>Perl 5.8.1 uses the /d switch when running the cmd.exe shell
internally for system(), backticks, and when opening pipes to external
programs.  The extra switch disables the execution of AutoRun commands
from the registry, which is generally considered undesirable when
running external programs.  If you wish to retain compatibility with
the older behavior, set PERL5SHELL in your environment to <CODE>cmd /x/c</CODE>.</P>
<P>
<HR>
<H1><A NAME="core enhancements">Core Enhancements</A></H1>
<P>
<h3><A NAME="utf8 no longer default under utf8 locales">UTF-8 no longer default under UTF-8 locales</A></H2>
<P>In Perl 5.8.0 many Unicode features were introduced.   One of them
was found to be of more nuisance than benefit: the automagic
(and silent) ``UTF-8-ification'' of filehandles, including the
standard filehandles, if the user's locale settings indicated
use of UTF-8.</P>
<P>For example, if you had <CODE>en_US.UTF-8</CODE> as your locale, your STDIN and
STDOUT were automatically ``UTF-8'', in other words an implicit
binmode(..., ``:utf8'') was made.  This meant that trying to print, say,
chr(0xff), ended up printing the bytes 0xc3 0xbf.  Hardly what you had
in mind unless you were aware of this feature of Perl 5.8.0.  The problem
is that the vast majority of people weren't: for example in RedHat releases
8 and 9 the <STRONG>default</STRONG> locale setting is UTF-8, so all RedHat users got
UTF-8 filehandles, whether they wanted it or not.  The pain was
intensified by the Unicode implementation of Perl 5.8.0 (still) having nasty
bugs, especially related to the use of s/// and tr///.
(Bugs that have been fixed in 5.8.1)</P>
<P>Therefore a decision was made to backtrack the feature and change it
from implicit silent default to explicit conscious option.  The new
Perl command line option <CODE>-C</CODE> and its counterpart environment
variable PERL_UNICODE can now be used to control how Perl and Unicode
interact at interfaces like I/O and for example the command line
arguments.  See <EM>perlrun</EM> for more information.</P>
<P>You can also now use safe signals with POSIX::SigAction.
See <EM>POSIX/POSIX::SigAction</EM>.</P>
<P>
<h3><A NAME="unsafe signals again available">Unsafe signals again available</A></H2>
<P>In Perl 5.8.0 the so-called ``safe signals'' were introduced.  This
means that Perl no longer handles signals immediately but instead
``between opcodes'', when it is safe to do so.  The earlier immediate
handling easily could corrupt the internal state of Perl, resulting
in mysterious crashes.</P>
<P>However, the new safer model has its problems too.  Because now an
opcode, a basic unit of Perl execution, is never interrupted but
instead let to run to completion, certain operations that can take a
long time now really do take a long time.  For example, certain
network operations have their own blocking and timeout mechanisms, and
being able to interrupt them immediately would be nice.</P>
<P>Therefore perl 5.8.1 introduces a ``backdoor'' to restore the pre-5.8.0
(5.7.3, really) signal behaviour.  Just set the environment variable
PERL_SIGNALS to <CODE>unsafe</CODE>, and the old immediate (and unsafe)
signal handling behaviour returns.</P>
<P>
<h3><A NAME="tied arrays with negative array indices">Tied Arrays with Negative Array Indices</A></H2>
<P>Formerly, the indices passed to <CODE>FETCH</CODE>, <CODE>STORE</CODE>, <CODE>EXISTS</CODE>, and
<CODE>DELETE</CODE> methods in tied array class were always non-negative.  If
the actual argument was negative, Perl would call FETCHSIZE implicitly
and add the result to the index before passing the result to the tied
array method.  This behaviour is now optional.  If the tied array class
contains a package variable named <CODE>$NEGATIVE_INDICES</CODE> which is set to
a true value, negative values will be passed to <CODE>FETCH</CODE>, <CODE>STORE</CODE>,
<CODE>EXISTS</CODE>, and <CODE>DELETE</CODE> unchanged.</P>
<P>
<h3><A NAME="local ${$x}">local ${$x}</A></H2>
<P>The syntaxes</P>
<PRE>
        local ${$x}
        local @{$x}
        local %{$x}</PRE>
<P>now do localise variables, given that the $x is a valid variable name.</P>
<P>
<h3><A NAME="unicode character database 4.0.0">Unicode Character Database 4.0.0</A></H2>
<P>Unicode Character Database has been updated to 4.0.0 from 3.2.0.</P>
<P>
<h3><A NAME="deprecation warnings">Deprecation Warnings</A></H2>
<P>There is one new feature deprecation.  Perl 5.8.0 forgot to add
some deprecation warnings, these warnings have now been added.
Finally, a reminder of an impending feature removal.</P>
<P>
<H3><A NAME="(new) version strings (vstrings) are deprecated">(New) Version Strings (v-strings) Are Deprecated</A></H3>
<P>Version Strings (v-strings) have been deprecated and they will be
removed in some future release of Perl.  Each v-string will trigger
the warning <CODE>v-strings are deprecated</CODE>.   The marginal benefits of
v-strings were greatly outweighed by the potential for Surprise and
Confusion.  If you really want to continue using v-strings but not to
see the deprecation warnings, use:</P>
<PRE>
    no warnings 'deprecated';</PRE>
<P>
<H3><A NAME="(reminder) pseudohashes really are deprecated">(Reminder) Pseudo-hashes really are deprecated</A></H3>
<P>Pseudo-hashes were deprecated in Perl 5.8.0 and will be removed in
Perl 5.10.0, see <EM>perl58delta</EM> for details.  Each attempt to access
pseudo-hashes will trigger the warning <CODE>Pseudo-hashes are deprecated</CODE>.
If you really want to continue using pseudo-hashes but not to see the
deprecation warnings, use:</P>
<PRE>
    no warnings 'deprecated';</PRE>
<P>Or you can continue to use the <EM>fields</EM> pragma, but please don't
expect the data structures to be pseudohashes any more.</P>
<P>
<H3><A NAME="(reminder) 5.005style threads really are deprecated">(Reminder) 5.005-style threads really are deprecated</A></H3>
<P>5.005-style threads (activated by <CODE>use Thread;</CODE>) were deprecated in
Perl 8.0 and will be removed after Perl 5.8, see <EM>perl58delta</EM> for
details.  Each 5.005-style thread creation will trigger the warning
<CODE>5.005 threads are deprecated</CODE>.  If you really want to continue
using the 5.005 threads but not to see the deprecation warnings, use:</P>
<PRE>
    no warnings 'deprecated';</PRE>
<P>
<H3><A NAME="(reminder) the $* variable really is deprecated">(Reminder) The $* Variable Really Is Deprecated</A></H3>
<P>The <CODE>$*</CODE> variable controlling multi-line matching has been deprecated
and will be removed after 5.8.  The variable has been deprecated for a
long time, and a deprecation warning <CODE>Use of $* is deprecated</CODE> is given,
now the variable will just finally be removed.  The functionality has
been supplanted by the <CODE>/s</CODE> and <CODE>/m</CODE> modifiers on pattern matching.
If you really want to continue using the <CODE>$*</CODE>-variable but not to see
the deprecation warnings, use:</P>
<PRE>
    no warnings 'deprecated';</PRE>

<HR>
<H1><A NAME="installation and configuration improvements">Installation and Configuration Improvements</A></H1>
<P>The UNIX standard Perl location, <EM>/usr/bin/perl</EM>, is no longer
overwritten by default if it exists.  This change was very prudent
because so many UNIX vendors already provide a <EM>/usr/bin/perl</EM>,
but simultaneously many system utilities may depend on that
exact version of Perl, so better not to overwrite it.</P>
<P>One can now specify installation directories for site and vendor man
and HTML pages, and site and vendor scripts.  See <EM>INSTALL</EM>.</P>
<P>One can now specify a destination directory for Perl installation
by specifying the DESTDIR variable for <CODE>make install</CODE>.  (This feature
is slightly different from the previous <CODE>Configure -Dinstallprefix=...</CODE>.)
See <EM>INSTALL</EM>.</P>
<P>gcc versions 3.x introduced a new warning that caused a lot of noise
during Perl compilation: <CODE>gcc -Ialreadyknowndirectory (warning:
changing search order)</CODE>.  This warning has now been avoided by
Configure weeding out such directories before the compilation.</P>
<P>One can now build subsets of Perl core modules by using the
Configure flags <CODE>-Dnoextensions=...</CODE> and <CODE>-Donlyextensions=...</CODE>,
see <EM>INSTALL</EM>.</P>
<P>
<h3><A NAME="platformspecific enhancements">Platform-specific enhancements</A></H2>
<P>In Cygwin Perl can now be built with threads (<CODE>Configure -Duseithreads</CODE>).</P>
<P>In newer FreeBSD releases Perl 5.8.0 compilation failed because of
trying to use <EM>malloc.h</EM>, which in FreeBSD is just a dummy file, and
a fatal error to even try to use.  Now <EM>malloc.h</EM> is not used.</P>
<P>Perl is now known to build also in Hitachi HI-UXMPP.</P>
<P>Mac OS X now installs with Perl version number embedded in
installation directory names for easier upgrading of user-compiled
Perl, and the installation directories in general are more standard.
(In other words, the default installation no longer breaks the
Apple-provided Perl.)</P>
<P>Mac OS X now builds Perl statically by default.  This change was done
mainly for faster startup times.  The Apple-provided Perl is still
dynamically linked and shared, and you can enable the sharedness for
your own Perl builds by <CODE>Configure -Duseshrplib</CODE>.</P>
<P>Perl has been ported to IBM's OS/400 PASE environment.  The best way
to build a Perl for PASE is to use an AIX host as a cross-compilation
environment.  See README.os400.</P>
<P>Yet another cross-compilation option has been added: now Perl builds
on OpenZaurus.  See the Cross subdirectory.</P>
<P>Tru64 gcc 3.2.1 <CODE>-O3 toke.c</CODE> dropped to <CODE>-O2</CODE> because of gigantic
memory use otherwise.</P>
<P>Tru64 can now build Perl with the newer Berkeley DBs.</P>
<P>Building Perl on WinCE has been much enhanced, see the wince subdirectory.</P>

<P>
<h3><A NAME="closures, eval and lexicals">Closures, eval and lexicals</A></H2>
<P>There have been many fixes in the area of anonymous subs, lexicals and
closures. Although this means that Perl is now more ``correct'', it is
possible that some existing code will break that happens to rely on
the faulty behaviour.  In practice this is unlikely unless your code
contains a very complex nesting of anonymous subs, evals and lexicals.</P>
<P>
<h3><A NAME="generic fixes">Generic fixes</A></H2>
<P>binmode(SOCKET, ``:utf8'') only worked on the input side, not
on the output side of the socket.  Now it works both ways.</P>
<P>For threaded Perls certain system database functions like <CODE>getpwent()</CODE>
and <CODE>getgrent()</CODE> now grow their result buffer dynamically, instead of
failing.  This means that at sites with lots of users and groups the
functions no longer fail by returning only partial results.</P>
<P>Perl 5.8.0 had accidentally broken the capability for users
to define their own uppercase&lt;-&gt;lowercase Unicode mappings
(as advertised by the Camel).  This feature has been fixed and
is also documented better.</P>
<P>In 5.8.0 this</P>
<PRE>
        $some_unicode .= &lt;FH&gt;;</PRE>
<P>didn't work correctly but instead corrupted the data.  This has now
been fixed.</P>
<P>FETCH etc may now safely access tied values (ie resulting in a recursive
call to FETCH etc).</P>
<P>At startup Perl blocks the SIGFPE signal away since there isn't much
Perl can do about it.  Previously this blocking was in effect also for
programs executed from within Perl.  Now Perl restores the original
SIGFPE handling routine, whatever it was, before running external
programs.</P>
<P>Linenumbers in Perl scripts may now be greater than 65536, or 2**16.
(Perl scripts have always been able to be larger than that, it's just
that the linenumber for reported errors and warnings have ``wrapped
around''.)  While scripts that large usually indicate a need to rethink
your code a bit, such Perl scripts do exist, for example as results
from generated code.  Now linenumbers can go all the way to
4294967296, or 2**32.</P>
<P>
<h3><A NAME="modulespecific fixes">Module-specific fixes</A></H2>
<P>Encode: if a filehandle has been marked as to have an encoding,
unmappable characters are detected already during input, not later
(when the corrupted data is being used).</P>
<P>PerlIO::scalar; reading from non-string scalars (like the special
variables, see <EM>perlvar</EM>) now works.</P>
<P>

<P></P>
<LI>
A rare access violation at Perl start-up could occur if the Perl image was
installed with privileges or if there was an identifier with the
subsystem attribute set in the process's rightslist.  Either of these
circumstances triggered tainting code that contained a pointer bug. 
The faulty pointer arithmetic has been fixed.
<P></P>
<LI>
The length limit on values (not keys) in the %ENV hash has been raised
from 255 bytes to 32640 bytes (except when the PERL_ENV_TABLES setting
overrides the default use of logical names for %ENV).  If it is
necessary to access these long values from outside Perl, be aware that
they are implemented using search list logical names that store the
value in pieces, each 255-byte piece (up to 128 of them) being an
element in the search list. When doing a lookup in %ENV from within
Perl, the elements are combined into a single value.  The existing
VMS-specific ability to access individual elements of a search list
logical name via the $ENV{'foo;N'} syntax (where N is the search list
index) is unimpaired.
<P></P>
<LI>
The piping implementation now uses local rather than global DCL
symbols for inter-process communication.
<P></P>
<LI>
File::Find could become confused when navigating to a relative
directory whose name collided with a logical name.  This problem has
been corrected by adding directory syntax to relative path names, thus
preventing logical name translation.

<LI>
A memory leak in the <CODE>fork()</CODE> emulation has been fixed.
<P></P>
<LI>
The return value of the <CODE>ioctl()</CODE> built-in function was accidentally
broken in 5.8.0.  This has been corrected.
<P></P>
<LI>
The internal message loop executed by perl during blocking operations
sometimes interfered with messages that were external to Perl.
This often resulted in blocking operations terminating prematurely or
returning incorrect results, when Perl was executing under environments
that could generate Windows messages.  This has been corrected.
<P></P>
<LI>
Pipes and sockets are now automatically in binary mode.
<P></P>
<LI>
The four-argument form of <CODE>select()</CODE> did not preserve $! (errno) properly
when there were errors in the underlying call.  This is now fixed.

<H1><A NAME="changed internals">Changed Internals</A></H1>
<P>These news matter to you only if you either write XS code or like to
hack Perl internals, or like to run Perl with the <CODE>-D</CODE> option.</P>
<P>The embedding examples of <EM>perlembed</EM> have been reviewed to be
uptodate and consistent: for example, the correct use of
<CODE>PERL_SYS_INIT3()</CODE> and PERL_SYS_TERM().</P>
<P>Extensive reworking of the pad code has been conducted by Dave Mitchell.</P>
<P>Extensive work on the v-strings by John Peacock.</P>
<P>UTF-8 length and position cache: to speed up the handling of Unicode
(UTF-8) scalars, a cache was introduced.  Potential problems if an
extension bypasses the official APIs and directly modifies the PV
of an SV: the UTF-8 cache does not get cleared as it should.</P>
<P>APIs obsoleted in Perl 5.8.0, like sv_2pv, sv_catpvn, sv_catsv,
sv_setsv, are again available.</P>
<P>Certain Perl core C APIs like cxinc and regatom are no longer available.
They never should have been, and if you application depends on them,
you should (be ashamed and) contact perl5-porters to discuss what are
the proper APIs.</P>
<P>Certain APIs like <CODE>Perl_list</CODE> are no longer available without their
<CODE>Perl_</CODE> prefix.  If your XS module stops working because some
functions cannot be found, in many cases a simple fix is to add the
<CODE>Perl_</CODE> prefix to the function and the thread context <CODE>aTHX_</CODE> as the
first argument of the function call.  This is also how it should
always have been done: letting the Perl_-less forms to leak from the
core was an accident.  For cleaner embedding you can also force this
for all APIs by defining at compile time the cpp define PERL_NO_SHORT_NAMES.</P>
<P><CODE>Perl_save_bool()</CODE> has been added.</P>
<P>Regexp objects (those created with <CODE>qr</CODE>) now have S-magic rather than
R-magic.  This fixed regexps of the form /...(??{...;$x})/ to no
longer ignore changes made to $x.  The S-magic avoids avoid dropping
the caching optimization and making (??{...}) constructs obscenely
slow (and consequently useless).  See also <EM>perlguts/``Magic Variables''</EM>.
Regexp::Copy was affected by this change.</P>
<P><CODE>-DL</CODE> removed (the leaktest had been broken and unsupported for years,
use alternative debugging mallocs or tools like valgrind and Purify).</P>

<H1><A NAME="new tests">New Tests</A></H1>
<P>In Perl 5.8.0 there were about 69000 separate tests in about 700 test files,
in Perl 5.8.1 there are about 75000 separate tests in about 750 test files.
The exact numbers depend on the Perl configuration and on the operating
system platform.</P>

<HR>
<H1><A NAME="known problems">Known Problems</A></H1>
<P>The hash randomisation mentioned in <A HREF="#incompatible changes">Incompatible Changes</A> is definitely
problematic: it will wake dormant bugs and shake out bad assumptions.</P>
<P>If you want to use mod_perl 2.x with Perl 5.8.1, you will need
mod_perl-1.99_10 or higher.  Earlier versions of mod_perl 2.x
do not work with the randomised hashes.  (mod_perl 1.x works fine.)
You will also need Apache::Test 1.04 or higher.</P>
<P>Many of the rarer platforms that worked 100% or pretty close to it
with perl 5.8.0 have been left a little bit untended since their
maintainers have been otherwise busy lately, and therefore there will
be more failures on those platforms.  Such platforms include Mac OS
Classic, IBM z/OS (and other EBCDIC platforms), and NetWare.  The most
common Perl platforms (Unix and Unix-like, Microsoft platforms, and
VMS) have large enough testing and expert population that they are
doing well.</P>

<h3><A NAME="tied hashes in scalar context">tied hashes in scalar context</A></H2>
<P>Tied hashes do not currently return anything useful in scalar context,
for example when used as boolean tests:</P>
<PRE>
        if (%tied_hash) { ... }</PRE>
<P>The current nonsensical behaviour is always to return false,
regardless of whether the hash is empty or has elements.</P>
<P>The root cause is that there is no interface for the implementors of
tied hashes to implement the behaviour of a hash in scalar context.</P>

<h3><A NAME="freebsd: malloc dilemma">FreeBSD: malloc dilemma</A></H2>
<P>The choice of malloc (the C-level memory management interface)
when building Perl is problematic in FreeBSD.</P>
<P>Using FreeBSD's system malloc for Perl was found to be very slow:
in some cases that was 200 times slower than using the Perl malloc.
One such case is file input: for example</P>
<PRE>
    # slurping the whole compressed Perl source code into $a
    if (open F,&quot;perl-5.8.1.tar.gz&quot;) { local $/; $a=&lt;F&gt; }</PRE>
<P>is about 200-250 times slower with the system malloc than with
the Perl malloc.</P>
<P>One could use Perl's malloc (Configure -Dusemymalloc), but that
was found to cause random core dumps in FreeBSD with multithreaded
programs.  No such problems were found in other platforms, however.</P>
<P>A decision was made to stick with the system malloc, regardless
of the performance problems.</P>

<h3><A NAME="hpux: hp cc warnings about sendfile">HP-UX: HP cc warnings about sendfile</A></H2>
<P>With certain HP C compiler releases (e.g. B.11.11.02) you will

<P>In the latest Tru64 releases (e.g. v5.1B) the gcc (3.3) cannot be

<h3><A NAME="win32: sysopen, sysread, syswrite">Win32: sysopen, sysread, syswrite</A></H2>
<P>As of the 5.8.0 release, <CODE>sysopen()/sysread()/syswrite()</CODE> do not behave
like they used to in 5.6.1 and earlier with respect to ``text'' mode.
These built-ins now always operate in ``binary'' mode (even if <CODE>sysopen()</CODE>
was passed the O_TEXT flag, or if <CODE>binmode()</CODE> was used on the file
handle).  Note that this issue should only make a difference for disk
files, as sockets and pipes have always been in ``binary'' mode in the
Windows port.  As this behavior is currently considered a bug,
compatible behavior may be re-introduced in a future release.  Until
then, the use of sysopen(), <CODE>sysread()</CODE> and <CODE>syswrite()</CODE> is not supported
for ``text'' mode operations.</P>

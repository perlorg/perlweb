The list above is almost certainly incomplete as it is automatically
generated from version control history. In particular, it does not include
the names of the (very much appreciated) contributors who reported issues
to the Perl bug tracker.
</p>

<p>
Many of the changes included in this version originated in the CPAN modules
included in Perl's core. We're grateful to the entire CPAN community for
helping Perl to flourish.
</p>

<p>
For a more complete list of all of Perl's historical contributors, please
see the AUTHORS file in the Perl source distribution.
</p>

<p>
The next major stable release of Perl 5, version 22.0, should appear in May
2015.  It will be the conclusion of the v5.21.x development series, which
will begin today and produce monthly releases on the 20th of each month.

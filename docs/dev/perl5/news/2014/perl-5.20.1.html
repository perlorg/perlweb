generated from version control history. In particular, it does not include
the names of the (very much appreciated) contributors who reported issues
to the Perl bug tracker.

Many of the changes included in this version originated in the CPAN modules
included in Perl's core. We're grateful to the entire CPAN community for
helping Perl to flourish.

We expect to release version v5.21.2 on July 20, 2014.	The next major
stable release of Perl 5, version 22.0, should appear in May 2015.
</p>

<p>
It's worth noting that there are a few known issues with this build.

Specifically, you may experience test failures for Socket on: Midnight BSD
Solaris.  And assorted test failures on HP-UX.	These will be addressed in
a future release.

=head2 Help! How do I unsubscribe?

Send mail to <perl5-porters-unsubscribe@perl.org>, and await a response.
Once you reply to the response, you'll be unsubscribed.

If that doesn't work, find your subscription address - it'll be in the
Return-Path header of any mails from p5p to you. If that's
God@heaven.af.mil, send mail to
<perl5-porters-unsubscribe-God=heaven.af.mil@perl.org>.

=head2 I'm not subscribed - how do I subscribe?

Send mail to <perl5-porters-subscribe@perl.org>.
To specify God@heaven.af.mil as your subscription address, send mail
to <perl5-porters-subscribe-God=heaven.af.mil@perl.org>.

=head2 How do I retrieve old messages?

Every message you get from perl5-porters will have an autogenerated
>>Return-Path line. For instance:
<perl5-porters-return-5523-God=heaven.af.mail@perl.org>

The number in the middle, 5523, is the sequence number. To get the
message with a particular sequence number mailed to you, send mail to
<perl5-porters-get.5523@perl.org>.

To a range of messages mailed to you in a digest, for instance, the
messages with sequence numbers from 4902 to 4950, send mail to
<perl5-porters-get.4902-4950@perl.org>. You may request a maximum of
100 messages in a single digest.

More general help on list management can be retrieved by sending
a mail to <perl5-porters-help@perl.org>.

=head2 Is there a web archive?

Yes, there is, and it's at
F<http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/perl5-porters/>.

=head2 perl5-porters is too big! Is there a digest?

Funny you should mention that. Rafael Garcia-Suarez and afterwards
David Landgren used to compile a weekly summary of the highlights, with links
to the archive where more extensive reading is recommended. These can be found 
at F<http://use.perl.org/> and at 
F<http://nntp.x.perl.org/group/perl.perl5.summary>. You can also choose to 
receive them by mail by subscribing to the <perl5-summary@perl.org> mailing 
list.

If you want to receive all the messages but batched into a single mail
per day, you can subscribe to <perl5-porters-digest@perl.org> instead;
send mail to <perl5-porters-digest-subscribe@perl.org>. Be warned that
replying to messages from the digest may end up messing up threading on
things like the web archive - at least set your outgoing Subject header
to the subject of the individual message you're replying to.

=head2 How do I get this document?

Uh, you're reading it, aren't you? Oh well, life is strange. Send
mail to <perl5-porters-faq@perl.org> and you'll receive a copy.

=head1 Questions about perl5-porters itself

=head2 What is perl5-porters for?

perl5-porters is, briefly, for all topics related to the development of
the Perl 5 language and the perl 5 interpreter. It's for reporting and
fixing bugs, working towards the next version of perl 5, and improving the
overall quality of the Perl 5 language.

=head2 What is perl5-porters not for?

    * Questions about programming Perl.
    * Questions covered in the Perl FAQ.
    * Spam.

=head2 Are there any rules?

No. However, Larry's advice from perlstyle apply just as well here as it does
to Perl programming:

    * Be consistent.
    * Be nice.

The established medium for messages is plain text. If your email client
wants to send things in HTML, please try and discipline it.

=head1 Development questions

=head2 How do I report a bug?

First, are you sure it's a bug in Perl itself, not just a bug in your
code? Take the problem out of the context of your current program and
write a short test program to reproduce it - as short as you possibly
can. It's far easily to clearly detect a Perl bug if it's demonstrated
in 5 lines of code, rather than buried somewhere in the middle of a
500-line program.

Next, do we already know about it? Check with the bug ticketing system
at F<http://rt.perl.org/perlbug/>.

It's always worth getting someone else to look it over and confirm that
this really is a Perl bug, not just a thinko. If there's nobody around
to do that, consider asking on the comp.lang.perl.misc or
comp.lang.perl.moderated newsgroups.

Now, if you've really got a bug, type "perlbug" at your prompt, and
follow the instructions. It really helps us if you provide: your
demonstration code, what you got, what you think you should have got,
and the relevant part of the Perl documentation that makes you think
that.

=head2 I want to get involved! What can I do?

Follow the list for a few weeks or months to get an idea of what goes
on, and see if anything pops up that you're interested in. Occasionally
someone will request a fix, and that's your chance!

If there doesn't appear to be anything you want to or are able to do, have a
look in your Perl source kit: you'll find the (outdated) file pod/perltodo.pod
- some of the items there are being worked on, so check back-issues of p5p.
Look also at the end of the last perldelta.pod. Furthermore, you don't need
to be an expert programmer: *anyone* can help with proof-reading, correcting
and expanding the documentation, for instance. There's certainly a place for
anyone who truly wants to get involved, and over time, you'll find it.

You should also read perlhack.pod, Porting/pumpkin.pod and
Porting/patching.pod - these will tell you how to create and submit
patches, as well as some more philosophical issues involved in patching
Perl. To summarise:

    * diff -ruN perl-current perl-patched > patch and append that
      verbatim, preferably not as an attachment, to your post.
    * Drastic changes to the syntax and/or operation of Perl are
      going to be viewed with a lot of suspicion. Start small.
    * Patches speak louder than words. Having ideas is good, but
      taking the time to implement them will improve their credibility.
    * At least one person will think your patch sucks. It's better to
      let the code stand on its own merits than get into arguments.

=head2 I've created a patch, but I'd like someone to check it over
before I post it to the list. What should I do?

The first thing you should do is relax! We don't bite, and we appreciate
people who want to help. Just go for it. However, if you're still
worried about whether you should send the patch, email the relevant
pumpking for the area you're patching, or one of the referees.

=head2 Is Perl in CVS?

Perl is actually available inside a git repository. git 
( L<http://git-scm.com/> ) is a popular, distributed and open-source version 
control system. To learn more about checking out the Perl source using
git see: 

L<http://perl5.git.perl.org/perl.git/blob/HEAD:/pod/perlrepository.pod>

=head2 What is the APC?

When a change was made on the Perforce server, a patch was generated and
placed in the Archive of Perl Changes. This is located at
ftp://ftp.linux.activestate.com/pub/staff/gsar/APC/

The directory diffs/ contains patches against the latest release.

All of this has probably became irrelevant after the switch to git.

=head2 What is perl-current?

perl-current used to bet the very latest Perforce snapshot of Perl. Now
the recommended way is to use git.

=head2 What is bleadperl? maintperl?

bleadperl is the term that is now used for the git C<blead> branch.

maintperl are the various maintenance branches:

  remotes/origin/maint-5.004
  remotes/origin/maint-5.005
  remotes/origin/maint-5.10
  remotes/origin/maint-5.6
  remotes/origin/maint-5.8

One for each released version of Perl.

=head1 Who's Who

=head2 What's a pumpking?

You didn't read Porting/pumpkin.pod, did you? :) A pumpking is the
person who holds the patch pumpkin, the responsibility for co-ordinating
patches on a specific area.

=head2 What's *the* pumpking?

*The* pumpking is the person who holds the patch pumpkin for Perl
itself, what other projects call the "release engineer". For perl 5.8,
the pumpking was Jarkko Heitaniemi. For perl 5.10, that's Hugo van der
Sanden.

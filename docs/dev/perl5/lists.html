<p>Some useful mailing lists if you want to get involved:</p>

<h3><a href="http://lists.perl.org/list/perl5-porters.html">Perl 5 Porters</a></h3>
<p>The primary development list for perl5</p>

<p>
The official forum for the development of perl is the perl5-porters mailing
list, mentioned above, and its bugtracker at rt.perl.org. All participants in
discussion there are expected to adhere to a standard of conduct.
</p>

<ul>
<li>Always be civil.</li>
<li>Heed the moderators.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Civility is simple: stick to the facts while avoiding demeaning remarks and
sarcasm. It is not enough to be factual.  You must also be civil.  Responding
in kind to incivility is not acceptable.
</p>

<p>
Failure to be civil and failure to heed the moderators will be answered by
removal from the list.  For more specifics, consult the file
<tt>pod/perlpolicy.pod</tt> in the perl5 git repository.

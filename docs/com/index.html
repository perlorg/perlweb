              <p>Any language&mdash;programming or natural&mdash;develops <em>idioms</em>,
            or common patterns of expression. The earth revolves, but we speak of the
            sun rising or setting. We talk of clever hacks and nasty hacks and slinging
            code. We ping each other on IRC to discuss spaghetti code, and we factor
            and refactor away the artifacts of copy pasta.</p>

            <p>As you learn Perl 5 in more detail, you will begin to see and understand
            common idioms. They're not quite language features&mdash;you don't
            <em>have</em> to use them&mdash;and they're not quite large enough that you
            can encapsulate them away behind functions and methods. They're something
            more than habits. They're mannerisms. They're our shared jargon of code.
            They're ways of writing Perl with a Perlish accent.</p>

            <h4><strong>The Object as <code>$self</code></strong></h4>

            <p><a href="http://learnperl.scratchcomputing.com/tutorials/objects/">Perl 5's
                object system</a> treats the invocant of a method as a mundane parameter.
            The invocant of a class method (a string containing the name of the class) is
            that method's first parameter. The invocant of an object or instance method,
            the object itself, is that method's first parameter. You are free to use or
            ignore it as you see fit.</p>

            <p>Idiomatic Perl 5 uses <code>$class</code> as the name of the class
            method and <code>$self</code> for the name of the object invocant. This is
            a convention not enforced by the language itself, but it is a convention
            strong enough that useful extensions such as <a
            href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?MooseX::Method::Signatures">MooseX::Method::Signatures</a> assume you will use <code>$self</code> as the name of
            the invocant by default.</p>

            <p>This is true even if you use <a
            href="http://moose.perl.org/">Moose</a>.</p>

            <h4><strong>Named Parameters</strong></h4>

            <p>Without a module such as <a
            href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?signatures">signatures</a> or <a
            href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?MooseX::Multimethods">MooseX::Multimethods</a>, Perl 5's argument passing mechanism is simple: all arguments
            flatten into a single list accessible through <code>@_</code>
            (function_parameters). While this simplicity is occasionally too
            simple&mdash;named parameters can be very useful at times&mdash;it does not
            preclude the use of idioms to provide named parameters.</p>

            <p>The list context evaluation and assignment of <code>@_</code> allows you
            to unpack named parameters pairwise. Even though this function call is
            equivalent to passing a comma-separated or <code>qw//</code>-created list,
            arranging the arguments as if they were true pairs of keys and values makes
            the caller-side look like the function supports named parameters:</p>

            <div class="programlisting">

            <pre><code>    make_ice_cream_sundae(
                    whipped_cream =&gt; 1,
                    sprinkles     =&gt; 1,
                    banana        =&gt; 0,
                    ice_cream     =&gt; &#39;mint chocolate chip&#39;,
                );</code></pre>

            </div>

            <p>The callee side can unpack these parameters into a hash and treate the
            hash as if it were a single argument:</p>

            <div class="programlisting">

            <pre><code>    sub make_ice_cream_sundae
                {
                    <b>my %args = @_;</b>

                    my $ice_cream = get_ice_cream( $args{ice_cream}) );
                    ...
                }</code></pre>

            </div>

            <div class="sidebar">

            <p><a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=yMMRnPQ7CSMC">Perl Best
            Practices</a> suggests passing a hash reference instead. This has one
            benefit of performing hash construction checking on the caller side, where
            it's most likely you'll make mistakes and another benefit of minimizing
            copying and memory use. The former benefit is compelling, if somewhat less
            common in practice.</p>

            </div>

            <p>This technique works well with <a
            href="http://perldoc.perl.org/functions/import.html">import()</a>; you can
            process as many parameters as you like before slurping the remainder into a
            hash:</p>

            <div class="programlisting">

            <pre><code>    sub import
                {
                    <b>my ($class, %args)  = @_;</b>
                    my $calling_package = caller();

                    ...
                }</code></pre>

            </div>

            <p>Note how this idiom falls naturally out of list assignment; that makes
            this idiom Perlish.</p>

            <h4><strong>The Schwartzian Transform</strong></h4>

            <p>People new to Perl sometimes overlook the importance of lists and list
            processing as a fundamental component of expression evaluation<font
            class="footnote"> (footnote: People explaining its importance in this
            fashion do not help)</font>. Put more simply, the ability for Perl
            programmers to chain expressions which evaluate to variable-length lists
            gives them countless ways to manipulate data effectively.</p>

            <p>The <em>Schwartzian transform</em> is an elegant demonstration of that
            principle as an idiom handily borrowed from the Lisp family of languages.
            (<a
            href="http://groups.google.com/group/comp.unix.shell/browse_frm/thread/31da
            970cebb30c6d?hl=en&pli=1">Randal Schwartz's initial posting of the
            Schwartzian transform</a> mentions "Speak[ing] with a lisp in Perl.")</p>

            <p>Suppose you have a Perl hash which associates the names of your
            co-workers with their phone extensions:</p>

            <div class="programlisting">

            <pre><code>    use 5.010;

                my %extensions =
                (
                    1004 =&gt; &#39;Jerryd&#39;,
                    1005 =&gt; &#39;Rudy&#39;,
                    1006 =&gt; &#39;Juwan&#39;,
                    1007 =&gt; &#39;Brandon&#39;,
                    1010 =&gt; &#39;Joel&#39;,
                    1012 =&gt; &#39;LaMarcus&#39;,
                    1021 =&gt; &#39;Marcus&#39;,
                    1024 =&gt; &#39;Andre&#39;,
                    1023 =&gt; &#39;Martell&#39;,
                    1052 =&gt; &#39;Greg&#39;,
                    1088 =&gt; &#39;Nic&#39;,
                );</code></pre>

            </div>

            <p>Suppose you want to print a list of extensions and co-workers sorted by
            their names, not their extensions. In other words, you need to sort a hash
            by its keys. Sorting the values of the hash in string order is easy:</p>

            <div class="programlisting">

            <pre><code>    my @sorted_names = sort values %extensions;</code></pre>

            </div>

            <p>... but that loses the association of names with extensions. The beauty
            of the Schwartzian transform is that it solves this problem almost
            trivially. All you have to do is transform the data before and after
            sorting it to preserve the necessary information. This is most obvious when
            explained in multiple steps. First, convert the hash into a list of data
            structures which contain the vital information in sortable fashion. In this
            case, converting the hash pairs into two-element anonymous arrays will
            help:</p>

            <div class="programlisting">

            <pre><code>    my @pairs = map { [ $_, $extensions{$_} ] } keys %extensions;</code></pre>

            </div>

            <div class="sidebar">

            <p>Reversing the hash <em>in place</em> would work if no one had the same
            name. In this case, that is no problem, but defensive coding anticipates
            data changes.</p>

            </div>

            <p><code>sort</code> gets the list of anonymous arrays and can compare the
            second elements (the names) with a stringwise comparison:</p>

            <div class="programlisting">

            <pre><code>    my @sorted_pairs = sort { $a-&gt;[1] cmp $b-&gt;[1] } @pairs;</code></pre>

            </div>

            <p>Given <code>@sorted_pairs</code>, a second <code>map</code> operation
            can convert the data structure to a more usable form:</p>

            <div class="programlisting">

            <pre><code>    my @formatted_exts = map { &quot;$_-&gt;[1], ext. $_-&gt;[0]&quot; } @sorted_pairs;</code></pre>

            </div>

            <p>... and now you can print the whole thing:</p>

            <div class="programlisting">

            <pre><code>    say for @formatted_exts;</code></pre>

            </div>

            <p>Of course, this uses several temporary variables (with admittedly bad
            names). It's a worthwhile technique and good to understand, but the real
            magic is in the combination:</p>

            <div class="programlisting">

            <pre><code>    say for
                    map  { &quot; $_-&gt;[1], ext. $_-&gt;[0]&quot;          }
                    sort {   $a-&gt;[1] cmp   $b-&gt;[1]           }
                    map  { [ $_      =&gt;    $extensions{$_} ] }
                        keys %extensions;</code></pre>

            </div>

            <p>Read the expression from right to left, in the order of evaluation. For
            each key in the extensions hash, make a two-item anonymous array containing
            the key and the value from the hash. Sort that list of anonymous arrays by
            their second elements, the values from the hash. Create a nicely formatted
            string of output from those sorted arrays.</p>

            <p>The Schwartzian transform is this pipeline of
            <code>map</code>-<code>sort</code>-<code>map</code> where you transform a
            data structure into another form easier for sorting and then transform it
            back into your preferred form for modification.</p>

            <p>In this case the transformation is relatively simple. Consider the case
            where calculating the right value to sort is expensive in time or memory,
            such as calculating a cryptographic hash for a large file. In that case,
            the Schwartzian transform is also useful because you can perform those
            expensive operations once (in the rightmost <code>map</code>), compare them
            repeatedly from a de-facto cache in the <code>sort</code>, and then remove
            them in the leftmost <code>map</code>.</p>

            <p>The original example in the comp.lang.perl.misc shows an effective use
            of the transform, and a good programming technique in general. When the
            data you have isn't in the optimal form for what you want to do with it,
            first transform it into that optimal form, then manipulate it.</p>

            <p>Phrased that way, the technique is so obvious as to seem trivial... but
            what is an idiom but a brilliant idea made vulgar by its ubiquity?</p>

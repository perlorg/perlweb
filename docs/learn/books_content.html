    Beginning Perl is a different kind of Perl book. It's written particularly with the beginning programmer in mind, but it doesn't treat you like an idiot, and experienced programmers will not feel patronized. It covers a lot of ground, from the very basics of programming, right through to developing CGI applications for the web. More importantly, it emphasizes good Perl practice, and readable and maintainable code.

    successful format of <i>Learning Perl</i>, each chapter in the book is designed to  
    be small enough to be read in just an hour or two. Each chapter ends with a  
    series of exercises to help you practice what you've learned with answers

    that separates the Perl dabbler from the Perl programmer.

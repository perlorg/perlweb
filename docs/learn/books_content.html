It covers a lot of ground, from the very basics of programming, right through to developing CGI applications for the web. More importantly, it emphasizes good Perl practice, and readable and maintainable code.

    successful format of <i>Learning Perl</i>, each chapter in the book is designed to  
    be small enough to be read in just an hour or two. Each chapter ends with a  
    series of exercises to help you practice what you've learned with answers

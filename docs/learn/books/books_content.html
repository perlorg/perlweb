    The latest Perl book targeting new Perl programmers is unique in that it focuses heavily on 'real world Perl' rather than the latest and greatest features. Despite the title of the book, this is far more than a beginner's book. By the time you're finished with the last chapter, you'll have finished building a Web application to fight DMCA takedown notices. Using tools such as DBIx::Class, Catalyst, Moose, Plack, and many others, this book teaches you the technologies that employers are asking for, but assumes no prior knowledge of Perl.

    <i>Beginning Perl</i> is a different kind of Perl book. It's written
    particularly with the beginning programmer in mind, but  experienced programmers will not feel patronised.
    It covers a lot of ground, from the very basics of programming, right
    through to developing CGI applications for the web. More importantly, it
    emphasises good Perl practice, and readable and maintainable code.

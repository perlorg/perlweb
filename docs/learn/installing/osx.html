<h3>
    A good setup for Perl on macOS:
</h3>

<ul class="installLinks">
    <li>
        <a href="osx_tools.html">macOS Editors and Terminals</a>
    </li>
</ul>

<ul class="instructions">
    <li>
        Install "Command Line Tools for Xcode", either directly or
        through Xcode, both available from
        <a href="https://developer.apple.com/downloads/">Apple Developer downloads</a>
        (free registration required). Xcode can also be installed through the
        App Store application.
    </li>
    <li>Open the <em>Terminal.app</em> (found in Applications -&gt; Utilities)
    and copy &amp; paste the command below into it (then press the
    'return' key):
    [% WRAPPER code_snippet %]curl -L https://xrl.us/installperlosx | bash[% END %]
    </li>
    <li>
        Once this is finished (it takes several minutes), quit the
        Terminal app.
    </li>
</ul>

<ul class="explained">
    <li>To build and install Perl and many of the thousands of useful
        <a href="/modules/">Perl modules</a> you need to have a <a href=
        "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compiler">compiler</a>. For macOS the
        easiest way to get a compiler is to install
        "Command Line Tools for Xcode" (about 100 Megs), either directly or
        through Xcode (several Gigs), both available from
        <a href="https://developer.apple.com/downloads/">Apple Developer downloads</a>.
        Xcode is also available through the
        <a href=
        "https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id422352214?mt=12&amp;ls=1">App
        Store</a> application. Some versions of the macOS install DVD or SSD come with the
        'developer tools', which contains Xcode. Only the 'unix tools' section
        of Xcode is actually required, no specific version of Xcode is needed,
        the latest is available directly through the App Store.
    </li>
    <li>To interact with the command line and run Perl commands, a terminal
    application is needed. macOS comes with Terminal.app by default, there are
    <a href="/installing/osx_tools.html#command_line">alternatives</a>
    available as well.
    </li>
    <li>macOS uses .bash_profile, but most other systems (and instructions) look
    for .bashrc, this code sets up .bash_profile to <em>also</em> run anything
    in .bashrc. There are <a href=
    "https://www.joshstaiger.org/archives/2005/07/bash_profile_vs.html">other
    differences</a> but these are not important to us.
    </li>
    <li>The <a href="https://perlbrew.pl/">Perlbrew</a> website lists many
    of it's advantages. We recommend it here because it separates your
    installation from the system Perl, this makes upgrading your OS less likely
    to cause issues with your own Perl setup. It also means you can use a newer
    Perl than the default one which comes with your OS.
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="https://metacpan.org/release/App-cpanminus/">App-cpanminus</a>
        provides the <code>cpanm</code> tool, which makes <a href=
        "/modules/">installing modules</a> very simple to do.
    </li>
</ul>

the list on that thread! If you do, you will not only meet face to face with a
XQJ-37 nuclear powered pansexual roto-plooker, but you may also be taken off of
the list. These people simply want to make sure the list stays topical, and
above-all, useful to Perl/CGI beginners.</P>

<P>Look in the FAQ! Get acquainted with the 'perldoc' utility, and use it. It can
save everyone time if you look in the Perl FAQs first, instead of having a list
of
people refer you to the Perl FAQs :) You can learn about 'perldoc' by typing:</P>
<P><CODE>perldoc perldoc</CODE></P>

<h3><A NAME="2.10 crossposting">2.10 Cross Posting</A></h3>
<P>
The beginners-cgi list, as well as the beginners list are sister lists. Many people subscribe to both lists. The beginners-cgi list was created solely to seperate CGI questions from Perl-only questions. This means that you should never, ever cross-post to both lists unless given permission. So, if your question is CGI related, post it _only_ to beginners-cgi, if it is not CGI related, post to the beginners. If you, for some reason, can't determine if your question is CGI related, well, I don't know what to tell ya :)

<P>
Beware of Perl4-like code-- You might find some script archives and
unauthorized mirrors with old Perl4 versions of Selena Sol and Matt Wright
scripts. Don't use those scripts. They are outdated and may even in some
cases contain bugs or security problems since many may not have been updated
in years. Instead, double-check the master archives at:
<BR>
Selena Sol (Perl4 and Perl5):
<a href="http://www.extropia.com/">http://www.extropia.com</a>
<BR>
Matt Wright's Scripts Archive (All Perl 4)
<a href="http://www.worldwidemart.com/scripts/">http://www.worldwidemart.com/scripts/</a>
<BR>
When looking at scripts, remember the guidlines in 3.3, below, to make an informed decision
if a script is one you should be using, or learning from.

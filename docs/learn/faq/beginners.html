nothing at all to do with Perl, it will likely be ignored. If it has anything
to do with Perl, it will likely be answered.</P>

<P>Please do not quote the documentation unless you have something to add to it.
It is better to direct someone to the documentation so they hopefully will read
documentation above and beyond that which answers their question. It also helps
teach them how to use the documentation.</P>

<P>Look in the FAQ! Get acquainted with the 'perldoc' utility, and use it. It can
save everyone time if you look in the Perl FAQs first, instead of having a list
of
people refer you to the Perl FAQs :) You can learn about 'perldoc' by typing:</P>
<P><CODE>perldoc perldoc</CODE></P>

<P>    
The beginners-cgi list, as well as the beginners list are sister
lists. Many people subscribe to both lists. The beginners-cgi list was
created solely to seperate CGI questions from Perl-only
questions. This means that you should never, ever cross-post to both
lists unless given permission. So, if your question is CGI related,
post it _only_ to beginners-cgi, if it is not CGI related, post to the
beginners. If you, for some reason, can't determine if your question
is CGI related, well, I don't know what to tell ya :)

Beware of Perl4-like code-- You might find some script archives and
unauthorized mirrors with old Perl4 versions of Selena Sol and Matt Wright
scripts. Don't use those scripts. They are outdated and may even in some
cases contain bugs or security problems since many may not have been updated
in years. Instead, double-check the master archives at:
<BR>
Selena Sol (Perl4 and Perl5):
<a href="http://www.extropia.com/">http://www.extropia.com</a>
<BR>
Matt Wright's Scripts Archive (All Perl 4)
<a href="http://www.worldwidemart.com/scripts/">http://www.worldwidemart.com/scripts/</a>
<BR>
When looking at scripts, remember the guidlines in 3.3, below, to make an informed decision
if a script is one you should be using, or learning from.

<P>
<H2><A NAME="3.3  how do I determine whether a script I download is a good one">3.3 - How do I determine whether a script I download is a good one?</A></H2>

<P>There are various criterea which can assist you in determining if a script
you download is a good one. We generally recommend that beginners do not learn
from Perl 4 scripts, or ones which may introduce bad habits. So, here are some
tips on spotting the good code:</P>
<UL>
<LI><STRONG><A NAME="item_default">Uses taint mode by default (probably indicates an awareness of security
issues).</A></STRONG><BR>
   
<LI><STRONG><A NAME="item_Uses_strict%2C_warnings_and_other_tools_that_enabl">Uses strict, warnings and other tools that enable clean coding practices</A></STRONG><BR>

<LI><STRONG><A NAME="item_scoping">Uses proper scoping (ie, using my and local where appropriate)</A></STRONG><BR>

<LI><STRONG><A NAME="item_pl">Use of CGI.pm instead of cgi-lib.pl (cgi-lib.pl is usually a giveaway
that a CGI script is written in the days of Perl 4)</A></STRONG><BR>

<LI><STRONG><A NAME="item_code">Modular use of code (modules or classes) instead of monolithic script</A></STRONG><BR>

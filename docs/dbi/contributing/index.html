      The dbi-users Mailing List
  </h3>
  <p>
      The dbi-users <a href="/support/">mailing list</a> is the heart of the DBI user community. There are typically over two thousand users subscribed, ranging from novices to experienced users and driver developers. Messages are on-topic and the list is widely regarded as being of very high quality. It's a great way to learn about the DBI and, as you learn from the list and your own experience, you can help others along their path.

      Changes and Enhancements
  </h3>
  <p>
      If you'd like the DBI to do something new, or different, a good way to make that happen is to do it yourself and send me a patch (a pull request or diff) to the source code that shows the changes. Information about how to do that can be found <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/DBI#CONTRIBUTING">here</a>, (including an important note about talking to me first to avoid duplicated or wasted effort).

  <h3>
      Sponsoring a DBI Enhancement
  </h3>
  <p>
      If your company would benefit from a specific new DBI feature or change, please consider sponsoring its development through my consulting company. The addition of the swap_inner_handle() method, for example, was sponsored by BizRate.com. Work is performed rapidly, and usually on a fixed-price payment-on-delivery basis. Contact <a href="mailto:Tim.Bunce@pobox.com">me</a> for details.
  </p>
  <p>
      Using such targeted financing allows you to contribute to DBI development, and rapidly get something specific and valuable in return.
  </p>
  <p>
      Thank you.

<h3>
    Contributing Help on the dbi-users Mailing List
</h3>
<p>
    The dbi-users <a href="/support/">mailing list</a> is the heart of the DBI user community. There are typically over two thousand users subscribed, ranging from novices to experienced users and driver developers. Messages are on-topic and the list is widely regarded as being of very high quality. It's a great way to learn about the DBI and, as you learn from the list and your own experience, you can help others along their path.
</p>
<h3>
    Contributing Changes and Enhancements
</h3>
<p>
    If you'd like the DBI to do something new, or different, a good way to make that happen is to do it yourself and send me a patch (a pull request or diff) to the source code that shows the changes. Information about how to do that can be found <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/DBI#CONTRIBUTING">here</a>, (including an important note about talking to me first to avoid duplicated or wasted effort).
</p>
<h3>
    Sponsoring a DBI Enhancement
</h3>
<p>
    If your company would benefit from a specific new DBI feature or change, please consider sponsoring its development through my consulting company. The addition of the swap_inner_handle() method, for example, was sponsored by BizRate.com. Work is performed rapidly, and usually on a fixed-price payment-on-delivery basis. Contact <a href="mailto:Tim.Bunce@pobox.com">me</a> for details.
</p>
<p>
    Using such targeted financing allows you to contribute to DBI development, and rapidly get something specific and valuable in return.
</p>
<p>
    Thank you.
</p>
<h3>
    Purchase a Support Agreement
</h3>
<p>
    My company also offers annual and multi-annual support contracts for the DBI. These provide longer-term sustained support for DBI development, and long-term security and value for you in return.

<h3>
    How much should I change?
</h3>
<p>
    That's between you and the module author. We are <b>not</b> here to take over modules.
</p>
<p>
    Maybe the author wants an overhaul. Maybe the author is very particular about indentation. Maybe the author just needs some bugs fixed. It's up to the author.
</p>
<h3>
    What if a module's author isn't interested?
</h3>
<p>
    Then we'll note that on the checklist and move on. It's up to the author. We will not make changes against the author's will. We are not here to take over modules.
</p>
<h3>
    What if we can't contact the author?
</h3>
<p>
    Hmm, I dunno. This is really a big CPAN issue.

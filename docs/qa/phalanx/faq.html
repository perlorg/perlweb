<h3>
    How did you come up with the <a href="/phalanx/100/">Phalanx 100</a> list?
</h3>
<p>
The specifics of how we derived the list isn't really important. We don't want
the focus of the project to become which modules are getting attention. We'll
be working on a wide variety of CPAN modules, as well as Perl itself, to
improve their tests and documentation.
</p>
<h3>
    No, but really, did you look at logs or something?
</h3>
<p>
It really doesn't matter. The list is made and that's what we're going with. We
think you'll agree that the 100 modules are a good cross-section of what's
popular on the CPAN. Maybe some got missed, maybe some shouldn't be on the
list. Still, it's a good start.
</p>
<h3>
    Why 100?
</h3>
<p>
It's a nice round number that used to be about 2.5% of CPAN. We figured
that the 80/20 rule applies, but in this case, 97.5/2.5 will have to do. (Note:
there are now over [% perl_stats.cpan_dists %] CPAN modules, so it's less than that.)
</p>
<h3>
    So, I bet you got logs from somewhere, right? Did you look at CPANTS?
</h3>
<p>
OK, ok, we'll tell you! It's a combination of:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Log analysis of search.cpan.org for the last 45 days of 2004
    </li>
    <li>Some manual editorial adjustments
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>
    Well, you know, you could have...
</h3>
<p>
    Yes, yes, we know. The list has been made and will probably not change.
</p>
<h3>
    But Foo::Bar is a LOT more important than DBI!
</h3>
<p>
That's fine. We can include Foo::Bar in the Phalanx project as well. The list
of 100 is just a starting point.

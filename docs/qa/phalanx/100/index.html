<p>
    Following are the 100 distros that Phalanx will be focusing on. This list may contain "dual-life" modules that are part of core Perl, but that are updated and distributed separately from Perl itself. Modules that are only distributed in core Perl will be handled in a different phase of the project.

    The <a href="/phalanx/faq.html">FAQ</a> has info about how this list was created.

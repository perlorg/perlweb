Measuring quality is hard, and so we coined the term Kwalitee which is
measurable (but inexact quality), so we can know it when we see it.

<h3>
    What is a bug?
</h3>
<p>
If there is any difference between the docs, the code and the tests, it is a
bug. Period. The bug might be in the docs or the tests, and the code is fine,
but it's still a bug.
</p>
<p>
If there is ambiguity about how the code is supposed to work, it is a bug. The
documentation must be clarified, and the code may be out of sync as well.
</p>
<p>
If a hoplite discovers something behaving "incorrectly", according to the
hoplite, it may or may not be a bug, according to the author's intent.

    </li>
    <li>Covered well

</ul>
<h3>
    Checklist
</h3>
<ul>
    <li>All object creation is checked with isa_ok(). Constructors are the most obvious, but any function that returns an object should be checked that the object is of the expected type.
    </li>
    <li>All temporary files are cleaned up. Check the return code from unlink(), and then check that the file is actually gone.
        <pre>
is( unlink( $filename ), 1, "Remove $filename" );
ok( !-e $filename, "Actually gone" );
</pre>
    </li>
</ul>

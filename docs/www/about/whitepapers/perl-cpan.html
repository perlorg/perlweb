<h2>
    CPAN - complete, mature ecosystem for Perl developers
</h2>
<p>
    <em>Stop reinventing wheels, start building space rockets</em>
</p>

<p>
    The <a href="http://www.cpan.org/">Comprehensive Perl Archive Network</a>
    (CPAN) is <em>the</em> place to go to find, download and install any of
    the incredible (and still growing) collection of Perl libraries. What other
    programming environment today offers [% perl_stats.cpan_dists %] modules of reusable
    code, for free, from one central repository?
</p>
<p>
    CPAN offers an integrated toolchain for developers to find the tools they
    need to get their jobs done. Far more than just an archive of code
    libraries, CPAN is a complete, mature ecosystem for the Perl developer.
</p>

<h3>
    Key features
</h3>
<ul>
    <li>[% perl_stats.cpan_dists %] modules available
    </li>
    <li>Single location to find Perl libraries
    </li>
    <li>Mirrored on [% c.mirrors %] servers around the world
    </li>
    <li>Automated testing: cross platform and on multiple versions of Perl
    </li>
    <li>Bug tracking for every library
    </li>
</ul>

<h4>Automated testing</h4>
<p>
    Following Perl's strong tradition of <a href=
    "perl-testing.html">testing</a>, every distribution of modules uploaded to
    CPAN is automatically <a href="http://www.cpantesters.org/">tested</a> on a
    <a href="http://stats.cpantesters.org/">variety of platforms and Perl</a>
    configurations. This happens without any intervention or effort from the
    developer: members of the community have set up a <a href=
    "http://www.cpantesters.org/">testing network</a> and donate their
    resources to making every Perl module as robust as possible on every
    platform they have available. This will typically include configurations
    developers hadn't anticipated or cannot access themselves: testers run code
    against many different Unixes (commercial and free) and various versions of
    Windows. This can provide invaluable debugging information for developers.
    Beyond just testing modules and reporting failures to developers, anyone
    can browse and search the full report database, to inform decisions about a
    module's maturity and suitability for their purpose.
</p>

<h4>Searching CPAN</h4>
<p>
    There are a number of Web sites focusing
    on searching the ever-growing collection of code comprising CPAN. These
    sites provide more services than just searching for a library to use: they
    also provide developer tools (grep, version-to-version diff). Another core
    feature of these sites is Web-based access to module API and usage
    documentation, written in Perl's integrated <a href=
    "http://perldoc.perl.org/perlpod.html">POD</a> (Plain Old Documentation)
    format.

    </li>
</ul>

<h4>
    Bug tracking
</h4>
<p>
    In addition to integrated testing and searching, every module uploaded to
    CPAN is given free access to a ticket queue in <a href=
    "http://bestpractical.com/">Best Practical's</a> Request Tracker system.
    Using this ticket queue, users can report problems they've encountered with
    any Perl library, and communicate with the developer throughout the
    development cycle. This ticket queue is created and the RT instance
    maintained free of charge and with no effort required of the developer,
    just like the other services provided by the Perl community for all modules
    uploaded.
</p>

<h4>World wide mirrors</h4>
<p>
    In tandem with all of the above, every module uploaded to CPAN is mirrored
    around the world. This provides developers and administrators with mirrors
    close to them, for fast and robust installation. The mirroring process is
    open, as is access to the repository contents. This enables administrators
    to configure local mirrors to enforce policy or minimize network usage. In
    this way, CPAN is both centralized but distributed: it is the one place to
    go for Perl libraries, but the files themselves are mirrored worldwide.
</p>

<h4>Different from any other language</h4>
<p>
    All of these efforts combined give Perl an advantage that no other modern
    programming environment can claim.

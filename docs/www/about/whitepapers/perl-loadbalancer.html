    Perlbal - Perl Reverse-proxy load balancer and web server
</h2>
<p>
    <em>Improving web performance and reliability</em>
</p>
<p>
    <a href="https://metacpan.org/module/Perlbal">Perlbal</a> functions as a load balancer
    and web server, improving reliability and flexibility with the ability to add and remove
    backend servers on the fly.
</p>
<p>
    As a reverse-proxy server Perlbal sits in front of your application web servers, proxying
    the inbound user request, enabling the application server to return content to Perlbal
    and then get on with the next request, even if the user is still downloading the content.
</p>
<p>
    A pool of backend servers can be easily configured and reconfigured on the fly. Perlbal will
    load balance across this pool and stop using any server which does not respond, allowing
transparent fail over and horizontally scalability for your web applications. Indeed Perlbal can
use different pools of servers for different URLs, through its <a href="https://metacpan.org/search?q=Perlbal%3A%3APlugin">Plugin</a> support.
</p>
<p>
    Perlbal is a perfect partner for any web server. Even if you only have one physical server, running
it will provide performance benefits (including serving your static content directly)
and prepare you for future scaling.

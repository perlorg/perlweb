    Perl and IPv6 - Perl supports IPv6

<p>
    <em>How to use both IPv4 and IPv6 networks from Perl</em>
</p>
<p>
    To enable IPv6 in Perl, replace any use of IO::Socket::INET with
    <a href="https://metacpan.org/module/IO::Socket::IP">IO::Socket::IP</a> and you will
    be able to use both <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ipv4">IPv4</a>
    and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv6">IPv6</a>. Perl 5.14 has the
    full set of IPv6 functions as part of its core Socket module.
</p>
<p>
    The Perl community is currently in the process of converting older modules
    to use this. If you use a module which has not been converted please report
    it to the module author.
</p>
<p>
    The IO::Socket::IP class provides a general-purpose socket that can provide
    <a href=
    "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protocol">TCP</a>
    connections or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UDP_packet">UDP</a>
    packets using either IPv4 or IPv6. It is an API-compatible replacement for
    its IPv4-only predecessor, IO::Socket::INET.
</p>
<p>
    IO::Socket::IP should be a direct drop-in replacement for IO::Socket::INET.
    It supports the same constructor arguments and the same methods as
    IO::Socket::INET, most programs only need to change the 'use' line and
    constructor calls, allowing them to support IPv6.
</p>
<p>
    Unfortunately IO::Socket::INET could not be upgraded in such a way that
    would not cause backwards incompatibilities; existing code may expect
    IO::Socket::INET to always return IPv4 sockets.
</p>
<p>
    Perl 5.14 ships with a complete set of IPv6-related functions in the Socket
    module. It provides the AF_INET6 constant, sockaddr_in6 address structure
    handling functions, and the getaddrinfo and getnameinfo functions.
    IO::Socket::IP uses these on Perl 5.14, making it an easy install requiring
    no other modules, nor compiling any <a href=
    "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XS_(Perl)">XS</a> code.
</p>
<p>
    On versions of Perl before 5.14, IO::Socket::IP needs a newer version of
    <a href="https://metacpan.org/module/Socket">Socket</a> to
    provide the IP protocol-neutral support, by way of the getaddrinfo and getnameinfo
    functions. This is available on CPAN and requires XS code to build.

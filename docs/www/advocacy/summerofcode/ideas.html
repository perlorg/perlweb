<p>Good projects...</p>
<ul>
  <li>...build on or integrate well with existing code</li>
  <li>...are a development of an existing project, rather than starting from scratch</li>
  <li>...provide more basic infrastructure or libraries that will provide the widest opportunities for others to build on the results of the proposal</li>
</ul>


<p>Some ideas...</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://svk.elixus.org/"><code>svk</code></a> has several tasks
  which would make <a href="http://svk.elixus.org/?SVKTasks">good Summer of
  Code projects</a>:
  <ul><li>Fully implement svk Public Key infrastructure.<br />
          svk allows you to sign and verify changesets. Implement the public
          key and policy infrastructure on top of it.</li>
      <li>Web GUI for svk users.<br />
          A web tool that at least allows svk users to merge one branch to
          another. Much of this could be re-used elsewhere. For example, a web
          implementation of 3 way-merge would benefit wikis and other online
          edit+versioning applications</li>
      <li>Thin client for svk.<br />
          Make the command layer of svk networked. This allows svk users in
          well-connected environment to use a specialized svk server without
          mirroring the repository.</li>
      <li>Revamp foreign version control system support.<br />
          We are currently using VCP which is not actively developed, and it
          also suffers from complicated abstraction to cope with the CVS
          model. Investigate and integrate tailor or other technology to
          provide robust foreign version control system integration. Separate
          the cvs changeset aggregation issue.</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li><a href="http://www.pjcj.net/perl.html#Devel::Cover.pm">Devel::Cover</a>
      provides code coverage metrics for Perl code.  There are plenty of tasks
      available which would make good projects.

      See the <a href="http://www.pjcj.net/devel-cover/projects.html">projects
          page</a> for more information.

      <ul><li>Use the new "MAD" code to report on coverage.</li>
          <li>Provide support for unreachable code.</li>
          <li>Improve on the current reports.</li>
          <li>Integrate profiling into reports.</li>
          <li>Threads support.</li>
          <li>Analyse tests and indicate how to improve coverage.</li>
          <li>Improve <code>cpancover</code> and create a central coverage
              repository.</li>
          <li>Implement path coverage.</li>
          <li>Implement mutation coverage.</li>
          <li>Test suite optimization.</li>
          <li>Improve tests.</li>
          <li>Something else useful and interesting.</li>
      </ul>
      Hopefully someone will find something here that piques their interest.
  </li>
  <li>The <a href="http://poe.perl.org/">POE project</a> has several
  <a href="http://poe.perl.org/?gsoc/2006">tasks that would make good Summer
  of Code projects</a>. For example:
  <ul><li>Bring POE closer to 1.0.  One of the documented goals for POE 1.0 is
          test coverage as complete as humanly possible.  We're currently at
          54%.  Bringing it up to 80% is probably a realistic goal for the
          Summer of Code.</li>
      <li>Implement base classes for POE::Stage.  POE::Stage is designed to be
          a standard class library for POE components.  It encapsulates some of
          the strongest component design patterns that have emerged in eight
          years of POE development, but it lacks many of the basic features POE
          already provides.  The goal is to duplicate POE's feature set in
          POE::Stage.  Luckily POE::Stage delegates most of the hard work to
          POE itself, so the bulk of the work will be designing and writing
          interfaces.  POE::Stage is on the CPAN, and its project is hosted at
          <a href="http://thirdlobe.com/">http://thirdlobe.com/</a>.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>You can discuss your ideas with the POE developers on <code>#poe</code> on
  irc.perl.org</p></li>
  <li>Reimplement the DBI v1 API in Pugs<br />
  Design an implementation of the DBI API in Perl 6 using Pugs.
  The goal is to maintain the familiar DBI API while radically
  refactoring the internals to make best use of Perl 6 and so
  enable greater functionality and extensibility. (Likely mentor: Tim Bunce)
  </li>
  <li>Create a "Web Application Toolkit" for the <a href="
  http://nms-cgi.sourceforge.net/">NMS project</a>.<br />

  NMS has been very successful at providing well-written re-implementations of
  certain popular but insecure CGI scripts, but the requirement to be
  "drop-in" replacements has constrained what could be done. The next phase
  is to provide entirely new programs based around a "Web Application
  Toolkit", wide variety of functionality without any programming knowledge
  on the part of the person configuring it, and it should be simply
  installed on the majority of shared web hosting that supports Perl CGI
  programs.  The work has been started - <code>TFmail</code> is the recommended
  replacement for the <code>FormMail</code> program.<br />

  The project would be to write this toolkit and scripts that use it. The
  toolkit should incorporate all <code>TFmail</code>'s functionality, but
  also support configurations as Guestbook, Web Discussion Board, Content
  Search, Link Exchange, or any combination. It's likely to need code to deal
  with

  <ul><li>Authentication</li>
  <li>Rate limiting of requests</li>
  <li>Session management</li>
  <li>Secure file handling</li>
  <li>Generalized and flexible error reporting</li>
  <li>Message threading</li>
  <li>Improved templating engine</li></ul>

  see <a href="http://nms-cgi.sourceforge.net/phase2.html">http://nms-cgi.sourceforge.net/phase2.html</a> for more information.
 (likely mentors: Dave Cross, Jonathan Stowe)</li>

  <li>Using Parrot and the compiler tools, write a parser for C header files
      that can generate Perl 5 NCI or Parrot NCI code.<br />
      It should let the developer write an SDL binding for either language by
      running the parser against SDL.h and its friends. For output, it would
      generate either or both Perl 5 and Parrot code that:
   <ul><li>opens the appropriate library with NCI or Parrot NCI</li>
       <li>binds to the functions with the appropriate data types</li>
       <li>declares the defined structs appropriately</li></ul>

    Developers should be able to include this generated code in the
    distribution so that <em>end users never have to run this compiler tools
    themselves or even have the headers for the libraries installed</em>.
    Obviously they need the NCI and bound libraries installed, but not the
    headers or even a C compiler.</li>

  <li>Implement a Perl 5 regular expression module for Parrot along the same
      lines as the Perl 6 grammar engine. This will allow the use of current
      Perl 5 regular expression syntax with the new engine.<br />
      There is an initial Perl 5 syntax parser to build from, which already
      passes some 600 tests, although the Perl 5 test suite provides plenty
      more! Of course, the tests that it's not yet passing are the ones that
      are syntactically more complex (<i>i.e.</i>, <code>(?...)</code>
      extensions) or otherwise more involved to implement, so this should
      provide plenty of interest. With the syntax is fully implemented, the
      next stage is to analyze and start to port over the optimizations from
      the Perl 5 engine. (likely mentor: Patrick Michaud)</li>

  <li>A Perl 5 to Perl 6 translator.<br />
      As the first stage of of translating Perl 5 to Perl 6, Larry Wall has
      been working on adapting the existing Perl 5 parser to output a complete
      abstract syntax tree, something it had never needed to do before. The
      current implementation can convert about 75% of the core Perl 5
      distribution back into byte-for-byte perfect source code (<i>i.e.</i>
      everything restored, including the exact whitespace and comment text
      normally discarded by a tokenizer). His work has been merged back into
      the core Perl 5 development tree. What is needed is for someone to
      complete this first stage proof-of-concept identity transformation,
      then to work with the Perl 5 and Perl 6 teams on converting the code
      from generating Perl 5 output to Perl 6 output.</li>

  <li>Improve Parrot's Tree Grammar Engine:
    <ul>
      <li>allow complex node selectors in rules</li>
      <li>find and implement a rule syntax other than PIR</li>
      <li>complete and document the default PAST and POST objects</li>
      <li>make the default objects available to all projects</li>
      <li>refactor out a default compiler framework for all projects</li>
      <li> optimize for memory use</li>
      <li>allow interpretation as well as compilation</li>
      <li>create a system that provides scaffolding of a new language
        implementation</li>
      <li>create default tree optimizations (SSA would be nice)</li>
      <li>create default POST -> PIR rules</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li>Benchmarks for the Parrot Grammar Engine. This will involve developing
      profiling and other code analysis tools for Parrot, as well as
      investigating approaches to improve the algorithms used in the engine
      and their implementations. (likely mentor: Patrick Michaud)</li>

  <li><a href="http://llvm.cs.uiuc.edu/">LLVM</a> &lt;-&gt; Parrot interop
  (likely mentor: Leopold T&ouml;tsch)
  <ul><li>Parrot as LLVM backend (LLVM -> PASM)</li>
      <li>PIR -&gt; LLVM (not really, but evaluate optimizations)</li>
      <li>Implement well-known optimizations in PIR compiler (SSA -&gt;
          register allocation)</li>
      <li> Runtime &amp; offline bytecode optimization</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>Create a compiler for LISS (Language of Integers, Sequences and Sets
      an educational language developed at Universidade do Minho) and target
      it into Parrot. As deliverables we expect the compiler (runnable on the
      three major architectures) and a tutorial/how-to explaining the compiler
      architecture (to be added in the documentation of Parrot as an example
      of a compiler). (Likely mentor: Alberto Sim&otilde;es or Leopold
      T&ouml;tsch)</li>
  </li>
  <li>Parrot JIT: improve &amp; complete JIT for some set of subsystems
      from alpha to Z8000 <i>i.e.</i> several pieces, one per platform</li>
  <li>Parrot threads: implement STM for Parrot (software transactional memory,
      as in GHC, <i>et al.</i>)</li>


  <li>Any collection of items from the <a
  href="http://mirrors.develooper.com/perl/APC/perl-current/pod/perltodo.pod"
  > Perl 5 TODO list</a> that would combine to a project of a suitable length.
  Good examples:

    <ul>
      <li>"A decent benchmark" + "Profile Perl"<br />
      Measure the performance of the Perl interpreter using free tools such
      as <code>cachegrind</code>, <code>gprof</code>, and <code>dtrace</code>,
       and work to reduce the bottlenecks they reveal.</li>
      <li>"The regexp optimizer is not optional" + "Make the peephole
      optimizer optional"<br />
      Perl 5's parser and the Perl 5 regexp engine both have optimizers.
      However, both optimizers are somewhat misnamed - as well as performing
      optimizations, they also perform transformations that are essential parts
      of the compilation processes. This means that they can't currently be
      disabled. Each would benefit from being split into two parts, separating
      out the essential compilation related-transformations, from the
      non-essential optimizations. This would allow the optimizations to be
      made optional, which allows the occasional bugs found in the optimizer
      to be more easily traced and eliminated.</li>
      <li>"iCOW" -- a plan for Copy-On-Write to speed up thread creation.<br />
      Perl 5's threading model runs each thread in a distinct interpreter.
      This has the benefit of low contention between threads, but the
      disadvantage that thread creation is slow. Sarathy and Arthur have a
      design for a Copy-On-Write system which will work across threads,
      allowing thread creation times to be dramatically reduced. The first
      stage of this project would be to test out the new model by implementing
      Copy-On-Write within a single thread. With the technology proven and
      debugged, the project would then move on to implementing the full COW
      semantics for thread creation.</li>
      <li>"Properly Unicode safe tokeniser and pads"<br />
      The tokeniser isn't actually very UTF-8 clean. Whilst Perl provides
      <code>use utf8;</code> to allow scripts to be written with variable names
      in UTF-8, globals are actually stored in stashes as raw bytes, without
      the internal UTF-8 flag set. Lexicals are stored in "PAD"s, and the
      API to access them is all bytes. If the input file handle for the
      program source code is marked by the IO system as UTF-8, the tokenizer
      ignores this. All this should be fixed.</li>
      <li>"Attach/detach debugger from running program"<br />
      Debuggers such as <code>gdb</code> and other tools such as
      <code>truss</code> can be attached to an existing running program.
      It should be possible to provide similar functionality with the
      Perl debugger, which would allow long running process to be inspected
      without restarting. On Unix <code>ssh</code> and <code>screen</code>
      address security concerns about connecting unrelated processes by using
      named pipes in <code>/tmp</code>. Maybe Perl can too. This project is
      likely to also evolve into many more debugger related improvements.</li>
      <li>"fix tainting bugs" + "Make tainting consistent"<br />
      Running the test suite with the taint warnings enabled reveals that
      many tests and some core modules are not written to be taint safe. It
      would be good for someone to work through these, identify and address
      the issues, so that as much of the core as possible can be used under
      the added protection that <code>-T</code> provides.<br />
      Related to this, tainting is documented as being able to take shortcuts,
      which allows the implementation to be more efficient. As computers have
      become faster but humans remain immune to Moore's law, this tradeoff
      is no longer optimal. The implementation of tainting should be changed
      so that taint is propagated exactly in step with data, so that
      programmers don't get hard-to-understand surprises when they are working
      with tainting enabled</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li>Polish up and finish off <a
   href="http://use.perl.org/~chromatic/journal/20481">Perl 5 Native Call
   Interface.</a> (likely mentor: chromatic).</li>

  <li>Automated testing for binary compatibility between versions of Perl.<br />
  Stable minor releases of Perl should be binary compatible, but there is no
  formal testing of this. The project would develop a testing architecture to
  verify that XS modules compiled with earlier minor versions still pass all
  tests when run with a Perl binary built from maintenance branch checked out
  from version control. The initial challenge in this project is automating the
  system sufficiently well that it runs reliably without attention or filling
  the local disks. Once that's done the interesting part can be tackled -
  correctly identifying all the test failure modes:
  <ul><li>when a module failing tests with an existing released Perl version is
  that the module author's fault, or a local setup problem?</li>
  <li>when an already built module's tests fail with the new Perl version, is
  that really a binary compatibility problem, or do they also fail if that
  module is built from clean with the new Perl?</li>
  <li>Is the observed failure actually because a dependency failed in the same
  way?</li>
  <li>Do you get the same results when you build dependencies with the old
  Perl but the module in question with the new Perl?</li></ul>
  And all this while minimizing both false positives (reporting a binary
  compatibility where none exists) and false negatives (missing one).
  Doing all this would also provide a very thorough testing of upcoming Perl
  releases with the CPAN codebase.</li>
  <li>Work on the <a href="http://ali.as/pita/">Perl Image Testing
  Architecture</a>, intended to comprehensively solve the problem of mass
  testing Perl packages against a wide variety of different platforms
  (possible mentor: Adam Kennedy).</li>
  <li>Build tools capable of migrating the Perl source repository from
  perforce to subversion.<br />
  This isn't a trivial task to get right. Existing tools such as <a
  href="http://search.mcpan.org/~autrijus/VCP-autrijus-snapshot/">VCP</a> are
  great for migrating most repositories, but every tool chokes when asked to
  migrate the nearly 30000 changes racked up in the past 9 years in the
  perforce repository that holds the core Perl source code. In particular,
  they fail to preserve the existing complex branching history, which we need
  to retain for code auditing purposes. This task would commence by researching
  the limits of the existing migration tools, to learn what they do,
  and deciding whether it is preferable to enhance them or instead steal their
  best ideas. The bulk of the project would be an iterative cycle of battle
  testing: running a migration, evaluating the corner cases where it failed
  (scope for automation here too), then working out how enhance the migration
  tools to cope. Getting the repository migrated is merely a side effect - the
  real deliverables here are reliable tools capable of manipulating and
  migrating everyone else's complex repositories.</li>

  <li>Ajax library for Template Toolkit, akin to the Ajax support in Ruby in Rails (likely mentor: the <a href="http://www.perl.com/pub/a/2005/06/02/catalyst.html">Catalyst</a> project).</li>

  <li>Build a suite of tools around WxWidgets for cross-platform GUI apps with low overhead (i.e., don't require Tk or GNOME overhead).</li>

  <li>A Perl SOAP library including WSDL support.</li>
</ul>

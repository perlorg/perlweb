<p>I, <a href="http://www.ccl4.org/~nick/">Nicholas Clark</a>, hereby offer
<strong>6 rewards</strong>, each of 100 guineas, to be paid to the Perl
Foundation, for the the first article deemed to be "good enough" by my judges,
in each of the following categories:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>INTERCAL is better than perl</strong><br />
</li>
<li><strong>Brainfuck is better than perl</strong><br />
</li>
<li><strong>Befunge is better than perl</strong><br />
</li>
<li><strong><em>$foo</em> is better than perl (three rewards)</strong><br />
</li>
</ul>

<p>100 guineas in real money is 105 pounds sterling. (about $160 or 160 Euros
at current exchange rates).  The intent is to make fun of articles which are
of the form "my language is better than your language". <em>$foo</em> here is
any language that makes a suitably funny subject when compared with perl in
this style.</p>

<p>Schwern and Greg McCarroll are the judges; please send your articles (and any
questions) to <em><a href="mailto:spoofathon@perl.org">spoofathon@perl.org</a></em>.</p>
<p>You can bribe the judges using <a href="https://donate.perl-foundation.org/">https://donate.perl-foundation.org/</a> :-)</p>

<h3>Why the advocacy spoofathon?</h2>
<p>There seem to be many language advocates who like writing "my language is
better than your language" comparison articles.  There have been several badly
researched <em>$foo</em> is better than perl articles in the recent past, that have
irritated myself and many other people in the perl community.</p>
<p>I can't comment on behalf of others, but there are several reasons why I find
these "<em>$foo</em> is better than perl" articles annoying. One subjective reason
is that they are putting down perl, but that's not my real bugbear. My bigger
irritations are threefold, and far more objective:</p>

<h4>Research quality</h4>
<p>
Typically these articles are drawing their conclusions based on the comparison
of some <em>$foo</em> code with perl code. The author is usually a seasoned <em>$foo</em>
programmer, and knows how to write good <em>$foo</em> code. But he/she is rarely
equally skilled at perl, so the perl code is far less sophisticated. Yet the
author feels that it is fair and objective to make comparisons in the
performance or maintainability of these unbalanced code samples, or to
criticise perl based on hearsay perceived faults while defending <em>$foo</em> on
the basis of true understanding.</p>
<h4>What gain does the negativity bring?</h4>
<p>
Usually these articles seek to promote <em>$foo</em> on the basis of it being better
than perl, trying to put perl down in the process. Why do that? What does it
gain? Surely <em>$foo</em> is capable of being promoted on its own merits?
Ultimately any tool that gets the user's job done correctly is useful, so your
audience's understanding of the abilities of your tool are not increased one
iota by wasting words bad mouthing anything else.</p>
<h4>People believe what they read</h4>
<p>
Many people read these articles uncritically. If they don't already know the
fallacies in the author's arguments, then they don't stop to question the
content. They just read, and believe they have learnt something useful.  It
hardly makes people more able to make an informed decision to chose <em>$foo</em>
over all other solutions (not just perl). Mis-education benefits no-one.
</p>
<p>I can't stop third parties writing these articles. But I do hope I can start
to make people treat them with the seriousness that they deserve. Hence the
competition.</p>

<h3>
    Jacinta Richardson
</h3>
<p>
    Jacinta has been credited for saving more than one Perl Monger group from dying and is often heralded as the "gardener of the Australian Perl Community", in the sense that she provides energy while subtly encouraging others to take responsibility. She is an active member in every Monger group in Australia, as well as many other FLOSS groups in the area. Her resume includes working to organize OSDC, Linux.conf.au, and SAGE conferences. She also works with Perl Training Australia in supporting the Perl community with such ventures as perl.net.au and Perl Tips.

<h3>
    Tatsuhiko Miyagawa
</h3>
<p>
    Despite his considerable technical contributions to Perl, Miyagawa is an active community organizer and advocate for Perl. He is so active in the Perl community that it is rumored that he never sleeps. For the past three years, he has been one of the main organizers for YAPC::Asia -- helping that event to break worldwide YAPC attendance records. He has organized numerous meetings for Shibuya.pm, growing it to one of the largest Perl Monger groups in existence and frequently organizes cross-language meetings and events.

<h3>
    Gabor Szabo

<p>
    Gabor Szabo is also a three time YAPC organizer (YAPC::Israel) and is also involved with OSDC::Israel and multiple Hungarian Perl Workshops. His contributions to the greater Perl community consist of countless weblog entries, comments, emails and support. His support of the Israel Perl Monger groups have made them some of the most vibrant in the world.

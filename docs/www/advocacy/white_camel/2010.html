<h3>
    Perl Advocacy: Paul Fenwick
</h3>
<p>
	Paul Fenwick is a tireless supporter of Perl and spends quite a bit of his time perfecting his speaking technique to draw large crowds for his Perl talk. Besides his many technical contributions, he works for Perl Training Australia, runs Perl Tips mailing list, and generally makes Perl fun and interesting to attract and educate new Perlers.

<h3>
    Perl Community: Barbie
</h3>
<p>
	Barbie is the glue that holds together CPAN Testers, the ad hoc group of people who download, test, and report on everything we upload to CPAN. Although there are a lot of technical aspects to making this work, creating and maintaining the community might be the hardest part of it. CPAN Testers success relies on attracting and retaining people who are interested in working with it.

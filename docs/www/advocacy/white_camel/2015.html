<h4>Perl User Groups - Chris Prather</h4>

<p>
Chris Prather, also known as perigrin, has been a tireless community leader for the <A href="http://orlando.pm.org">Orlando Perl mongers</a> and a conference organizer for <a href="http://www.perloasis.info">Perl Oasis</a>, <A href="http://www.yapcna.org/yn2011/">YAPC::NA 2011</a> in Ashville, and <A href="http://www.yapcna.org/yn2015/">YAPC::NA 2014</a> in Orlando.

<h4>Perl Advocacy - Sawyer X</h4>

<p>
You can hardly go to a Perl conference (or <a href="http://amsterdamx.pm.org">Amsterdam X Perl mongers</a>) without hearing Sawyer X talk about the wonders of the Perl community (e.g. <A href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjOQZf0Ad74">The Joy in What We Do</a>). He writes the <a href="http://blogs.perl.org/users/sawyer_x/p5p-summary/">Perl 5 Porters weekly summaries</a> and has been a driving force in the Dancer community. No matter where he shows up, in person or online, he's been the shining light of kindness and helpfulness that makes the Perl community a nice place to move bits around.

<h4>Perl Community - Steffen Müller</h4>

<p>
Steffen Müller, also known as tsee, has done quite a bit of technical work for the Perl community, but he's one of the people helping with the non-technical aspects in too many ways to mention. He's especially stood out in recent years with his work through Booking.com, writing for <a href="http://blog.booking.com/author/steffen-muller.html">their technical blog</a> and being a driving force behind <a href="http://news.perlfoundation.org/2015/08/bookingcom-donate-60000-to-per-1.html">Booking.com's generous donations</a> to The <a href="http://www.perlfoundation.org/perl_5_core_maintenance_fund">Core Maintenance Fund</a>.

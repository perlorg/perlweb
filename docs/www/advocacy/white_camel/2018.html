<h3>Perl Community - Todd Rinaldo, all sorts of things</h3>

<p>
Todd Rinaldo has done plenty of technical work for Perl (you can blame him for taking . out of @INC), but's he's done quite a bit of non-technical work for the community as well. He's helped to organize Perl conferences and hackathons and provided other support through one of Perl's largest financial contributors, <a href="https://cpanel.net/">cPanel</a>.

<h3>Perl Advocacy - David Farrell, for Perltricks and Perl.com</h3>

<p>
David Farrell started the PerlTricks.com site in 2013, then ressurrected Perl.com in 2017 (merging PerlTricks into it at the same time). He moved Perl.com to a GitHub repository that anyone can send pull requests to. Now it's easier than ever to not only create new content but update existing articles. He's also one of the co-organizers of the New York Perl mongers.

<h3>Perl User Groups - Max Maischein</h3>

<p>
<a href="https://frankfurt.pm">Frankfurt.pm</a> hosts the <a href="https://german-perl-workshop.de">German and the Frankfurt Perl-Workshops</a> and other special events (including YAPC::EU 2012). Max Maischein has been its treasurer since 2011, handling the accounting, reporting, and contracting, as well as coordinating work with other local organizations. Without that important work nothing could get done. He's part of the backbone of the German Perl community.

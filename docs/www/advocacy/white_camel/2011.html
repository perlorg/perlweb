<h3>
    Perl Community: Leo Lapworth
</h3>
<p>
You may have noticed that many of the core Perl sites, such as <a href="http://www.cpan.org">www.cpan.org</a> and <a href="http://www.perl.org">www.perl.org</a> look a lot different. Indeed, they look a lot better. Perl, being very popular in the early days of the web, it’s websites settled on the early features and never left them. Leo Lapworth dragged many of the Perl websites into the modern age and made them look more attractive at the same time. Not only that, he’s one of the driving forces behind <a href="http://perlnews.org/">Perl News</a>. Surely there’s more to come from Leo, too. For this, we recognize Leo Lapworth for the 2011 White Camel Award for Perl community.

<h3>
    Perl User Groups: Daisuke Maki
</h3>
<p>
If you’re doing Perl in Japan, you’ve probably run into Daisuke Maki. He’s active in Shibuya.pm and many of the YAPC::Asia. He also started the Japan Perl Association, the counterpart to The Perl Foundation and YAPC::Europe Foundation. For this, we recognize Daisuke Maki for the 2011 White Camel Award for Outstanding Contribution to Perl user groups.

<h3>
    Perl Conferences: Andrew Shitov
</h3>
<p>
If there were a contest for the most Perl events organized, Andrew would most likely be the winner. The number of conferences isn’t the only category he’d win though. He’s not content just to organized conferences in his own country, Russia, but also in Bulgaria, the Ukraine, Belarus, Uzbekistan, and many others. He’s also win the competition for organizing two events the farthest apart: The <a href="http://event.perlrussia.ru/fe2008/">Second Russian Perl Workshop</a> in Vladivostok and <a href="http://yapc.eu/2011">YAPC::EU 2011</a> in Rīga, Latvia. That’s still not enough. He’s the moving force behind <a href="http://yapc.tv">YAPC::TV</a>, which collects videos from Perl events and lets you view them for free. For this, we recognize Andrew Shitov for the 2011 White Camel Award for Perl conferences.

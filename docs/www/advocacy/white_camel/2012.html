<h3>
    Perl Community: Renee Bäcker
</h3>
<p>
    Renee Bäcker is at the heart of the German Perl community. He
    publishes <a href="http://foo-magazin.de/">$foo Magazine</a>, a sponsor of this conference, is a leader in
    the <a href="http://www.perlmongers.de/">German Perl monger</a> community, and is organizing this year's
    <a href="http://act.yapc.eu/ye2012/">YAPC::EU</a> in Frankfurt (although he was already short-listed for this
    award before we knew that).

<h3>
    Perl User Groups: Jim Keenan
</h3>
<p>
    Jim Keenan has been a quiet but effective Perl influence. For years he
    led Perl Seminar New York, a technical complement to <a href="http://ny.pm.org/">NY.pm</a>'s social
    focus. He volunteers to help at many hackathons, gently advises new
    events, and was instrumental in bringing together separate Perl groups
    within New York City.

<h3>
    Perl Conferences: Breno G. de Oliveira
</h3>
<p>
    Breno G. de Oliveira, or just "garu", is a social connector in the
    Brasilian Perl community as well as the <a href="http://sdl.perl.org/">PerlSDL</a> community. Active in
    <a href="http://rio.pm.org/">Rio.pm</a>, he's was also the organizer of <a href="http://yapcbrasil.org.br/2011/">YAPC::Brasil 2011</a> in Rio de
    Janeiro. He's contributed to the PerlSDL book. With a little help, he
    wants to unite the global Perl community by visiting every YAPC he can
    and helping other people to travel to Brasil to meet Perl programmers
    they might not otherwise interact with.

        The Camel has been the symbol of Perl since its appearance on the
        cover of the first edition
        of <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/programming-perl-4th/9781449321451/" >Programming
        Perl</a>. The camel with the topic of Perl is a trademark of
        <a href="http://www.ora.com">O’Reilly Media, Inc.</a> Used with permission.

    <p>
          O'Reilly <a href="https://neilb.org/2020/12/04/perl-and-camels.html">confirmed</a> that Perl cannot use the specific camel image from the Programming Perl book, 
          but a new camel image could be used. 
          The key restriction is that no other publisher can use a camel on the cover of a book about Perl, 
        </a>

        From <a href="https://perladvent.org/2024/2024-12-23.html">Dec 2024</a>
        a new Perl logo featuring a new camel started to be used.

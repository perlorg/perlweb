    Beginning Perl is a different kind of Perl book. It's written particularly with the beginning programmer in mind, but it doesn't treat you like an idiot, and experienced programmers will not feel patronized. It covers a lot of ground, from the very basics of programming, right through to developing CGI applications for the web. More importantly, it emphasizes good Perl practice, and readable and maintainable code.

        In the Perl community, we have discovered ways to save time by writing Perl programs that make our jobs and lives easier. Surely, Perl is not a panacea, but it has certainly made our lives a little bit better. It is hoped that you can use Perl to make your jobs and lives easier, too.

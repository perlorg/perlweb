<p>
You write code for a living, and your inherit a legacy program written
in Perl. You can program in your native language in your sleep. But
you don't know Perl at all, or you've only dabbled with it. Your
deadline doesn't give you enough time to rewrite the legacy program in
your native language, but it needs new features. You need to learn
Perl, and you need to learn it NOW. "Impatient Perl" was written for
you.

<h4>The Impatient Introduction to Perl</h4>
<p>
This document is for people who either want to learn Perl or are
already programming in Perl and just don't have the patience to
scrounge for information to learn and use Perl.  This document should
also find use as a handy desk reference for some of the more common
perl related questions.

<h4>The history of Perl in 100 words or less</h4>

<p>
In the mid 1980's, Larry Wall was working as a sysadmin and found that
he needed to do a number of common, yet oddball functions over and
over again. And he didn't like any of the scripting languages that
were around at the time, so he invented Perl. Version 1 was released
circa 1987. A few changes have occurred between then and now. The
current version of Perl has exceeded 5.8.0 and is a highly recommended
upgrade.

<ul>
    <li>1U or 2U servers, preferably i386 or AMD64 for our <a href="http://noc.perl.org/">various services</a> (web, email, revision control, ...). At least 8GB ram and room for two or more disks (we have all our system disks mirrored).
    </li>
    <li>Sometimes large SATA disks
    </li>
    <li>Servers in Asia for mirroring search.cpan.org, perldoc.perl.org and related services (we're well covered in North America and have a server in London, too). Can be virtual or real hardware, but needs to run RHEL (we can provide media and license) and have 4GB ram or more.
    </li>
    <li>Managed Gigabit Switch (~24 ports). We have an old Dell one, but if someone has a spare HP or Cisco quality one...
    </li>
    <li>An industrial strength NAS - NetAPP or EMC or similar.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    If you have some other useful spare hardware or can help in another way, email webmaster at perl.org and we'll see if we can make use of it.
